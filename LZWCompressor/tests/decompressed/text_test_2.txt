THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by SIR ARTHUR 
CONAN DOYLE
ADVENTURE I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA.
I.
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any 
other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he 
felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect 
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed 
himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. 
They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives 
and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and 
finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt 
upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own highpower lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And 
yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and 
questionable memory.
I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own 
complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first 
finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while
Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our 
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week 
between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own 
keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his 
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and 
clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From 
time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of 
the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at 
Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and 
successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, 
which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend 
and companion.
One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient 
(for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I 
passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my 
wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to 
see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms 
were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark 
silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon 
his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his 
attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was 
shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a 
word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of 
cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire 
and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half 
pounds since I saw you."
"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice 
again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."
"Then, how do you know?"
"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and 
that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you 
lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a 
dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary 
Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you 
work it out."
He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where 
the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been 
caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to 
remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in 
vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London 
slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a 
black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not 
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I 
hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously 
simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am 
baffled until you explain your process.
And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You 
see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the 
steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
"Frequently." "How often?"
"Well, some hundreds of times." "Then how many are there?" "How many? I don't know."
"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know 
that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you 
are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two 
of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pinktinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. 
"Read it aloud."
The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who 
desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with 
matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we 
have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss 
if your visitor wear a mask."
"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"
"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins 
to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you 
deduce from it?"
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my 
companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is 
peculiarly strong and stiff."
"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the 
light."
I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into 
the texture of the paper.
"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 
'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for 
the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from 
his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in 
Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, 
and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of 
that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction 
of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or 
Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only 
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian 
paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, 
followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little 
brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this 
case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be 
interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."
"But your client--"
"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that 
armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."
A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused 
immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.
"Come in!" said Holmes.
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest 
and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked 
upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts
of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders 
was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a 
single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at 
the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was 
suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore 
across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, 
which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he 
entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a 
thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of 
obstinacy.
"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I 
told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to 
address.
"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is 
occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this 
gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of 
the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, 
or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to 
absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon 
European history."
"I promise," said Holmes. "And I."
"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me 
wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have 
just called myself is not exactly my own."
"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what 
might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of 
Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of 
Bohemia."
"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing 
his eyes.
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who 
had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in 
Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able 
to advise you."
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. 
Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the 
ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I 
was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, 
and hereditary King of Bohemia."
"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his 
hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing 
such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an 
agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose 
of consulting you."
"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the 
acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to 
you."
"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For 
many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so 
that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi 
and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La 
Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! 
Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young 
person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters 
back."
"Precisely so. But how--" "Was there a secret marriage?" "None."
"No legal papers or certificates?" "None."
"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for 
blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"
"There is the writing." "Pooh, pooh! Forgery." "My private note-paper." "Stolen."
"My own seal." "Imitated."
"My photograph." "Bought."
"We were both in the photograph."
"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."
"I was mad--insane."
"You have compromised yourself seriously."
"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now." "It must be recovered."
"We have tried and failed."
"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought." "She will not sell."
"Stolen, then."
"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we 
diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no 
result."
"No sign of it?" "Absolutely none."
Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he. "But a very serious one to me," 
returned the King reproachfully.
"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?" "To ruin me."
"But how?"
"I am about to be married." "So I have heard."
"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may 
know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a 
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
"And Irene Adler?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do 
not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and 
the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no 
lengths to which she would not go--none."
"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?" "I am sure."
"And why?"
"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly 
proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have 
one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay 
in London for the present?"
"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm." "Then I 
shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety." "Then, as to money?"
"You have carte blanche." "Absolutely?"
"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph." "And 
for present expenses?"
The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. "There 
are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. "And 
Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?" "It 
was."
"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. 
And
good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If 
you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this 
little matter over with you."
II.
At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady 
informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down 
beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was 
already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and 
strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, 
still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. 
Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was 
something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a 
pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which 
he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success 
that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and 
side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. 
Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three 
times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, 
whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands 
into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some 
minutes.
"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, 
limp and helpless, in the chair.
"What is it?"
"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I 
ended by doing."
"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of 
Miss Irene Adler."
"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little 
after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful 
sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that 
there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but 
built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on 
the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous 
English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save 
that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it 
and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.
"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane 
which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their 
horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, 
and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen 
other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose 
biographies I was compelled to listen to."
"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a 
bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at 
concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at 
other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is 
dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. 
Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had 
driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had 
listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and 
to think over my plan of campaign.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That 
sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated 
visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred 
the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question 
depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the 
gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my 
inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties,if 
you are to understand the situation."
"I am following you closely," I answered.
"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and 
a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached-
- evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the
cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who 
was thoroughly at home.
"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of 
the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see 
nothing.
Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he 
pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 
'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the 
Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'
"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when 
up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his 
tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't 
pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the 
moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty 
minutes.'
"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or 
whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver 
looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. 
Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five 
minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The 
cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid 
the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had 
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all 
three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who 
has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, 
and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!' "'What then?' I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
11
"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling 
responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, 
and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, 
bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one 
side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most 
preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that 
started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their 
license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, 
and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in 
search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain 
in memory of the occasion."
"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"
"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate 
departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church 
door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I 
shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove 
away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."
"Which are?"
"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to 
think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your 
co-operation."
"I shall be delighted."
"You don't mind breaking the law?" "Not in the least."
"Nor running a chance of arrest?" "Not in a good cause."
"Oh, the cause is excellent!" "Then I am your man."
"I was sure that I might rely on you." "But what is it you wish?"
"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he 
turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, 
for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. 
Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to 
meet her."
"And what then?"
"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on 
which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
"I am to be neutral?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It 
will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room 
window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."
"Yes."
"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you." "Yes."
"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, 
at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"
"Entirely."
"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar- shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an 
ordinary plumber's smoke- rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your 
task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of 
people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope 
that I have made myself clear?"
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this 
object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
"Precisely."
"Then you may entirely rely on me."
"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to 
play."
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable 
and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white 
tie, his
sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John 
Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His 
expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. 
The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist 
in crime.
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour 
when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just 
being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its 
occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct 
description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a 
small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of 
shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two 
guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were 
lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather 
simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are 
that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its 
coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"
"Where, indeed?"
"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy 
concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid 
and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that 
she does not carry it about with her."
"Where, then?"
"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. 
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it 
over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect 
or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that 
she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It 
must be in her own house." "But it has twice been burgled."
"Pshaw! They did not know how to look." "But how will you look?"
"I will not look." "What then?"
"I will get her to show me." "But she will refuse."
"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my 
orders to the letter."
As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It 
was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of 
the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, 
but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce 
quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the 
loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was 
struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little 
knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. 
Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and 
dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen 
took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of betterdressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the 
lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the 
steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, 
looking back into the street.
"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked. "He is dead," cried several voices.
"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to 
hospital."
"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it 
hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
14
"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I 
still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the 
blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know 
whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I 
know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful 
creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited 
upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now 
from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket 
from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her 
from injuring another.
Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A 
maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand 
and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner 
out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, 
and servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through 
the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment 
later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through 
the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced 
to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly 
and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which 
lead towards the Edgeware Road.
"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right." 
"You have the photograph?"
"I know where it is."
"And how did you find out?"
"She showed me, as I told you she would." "I am still in the dark."
"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of 
course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the 
evening."
"I guessed as much."
"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed 
forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old 
trick."
"That also I could fathom."
"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her 
sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
15
and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were 
compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."
"How did that help you?"
"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to 
rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more 
than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use 
to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an 
unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had 
nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to 
secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake 
nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel 
just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she 
half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the 
rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, 
escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but 
the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A 
little over-precipitance may ruin all."
"And now?" I asked.
"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care 
to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable 
that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to 
his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."
"And when will you call?"
"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we 
must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must 
wire to the King without delay."
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for 
the key when someone passing said:
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come 
from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder 
who the deuce that could have been."
III.
I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the 
morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking 
eagerly into his face.
"Not yet."
"But you have hopes?" "I have hopes."
"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone." "We must have a cab."
"No, my brougham is waiting."
"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge. 
"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
"Married! When?"
"Yesterday." "But to whom?"
"To an English lawyer named Norton." "But she could not love him."
"I am in hopes that she does." "And why in hopes?"
"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her 
husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason 
why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have 
made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine 
Avenue.
The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched 
us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather 
startled gaze.
"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her 
husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."
"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that 
she has left England?"
"Never to return."
"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the 
King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves 
and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed 
at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a 
photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter 
was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open and 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this 
way:
"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. 
Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed 
myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the 
King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, 
with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I 
found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been 
trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the 
freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my 
walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to 
the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and 
started for the Temple to see my husband.
"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; 
so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may 
rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will 
without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, 
and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in 
the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. 
Sherlock Holmes,
"Very truly yours, "IRENE NORTON, née ADLER."
"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read 
this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an 
admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your 
Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's 
business to a more successful conclusion."
"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that 
her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He 
slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes. "You have 
but to name it."
"This photograph!"
The King stared at him in amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
18
"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to 
wish you a very good-morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand 
which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the 
best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over 
the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene 
Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the 
woman.
ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found 
him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. 
With an apology for my
intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed 
the door behind me.
"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially. "I was 
afraid that you were engaged."
"So I am. Very much so."
"Then I can wait in the next room."
"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most 
successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little 
questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.
"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as 
was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all 
that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have 
shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will 
excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.
"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple 
problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary 
combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the 
imagination."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
19
"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep 
on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges 
me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this 
morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have 
listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique 
things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and 
occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been 
committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an 
instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I 
have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence 
your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.
Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes 
me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some 
slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other 
similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the 
facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty 
and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the 
advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, 
I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the 
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an 
average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy 
grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and 
a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling 
down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet 
collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable 
about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent 
upon his features.
Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he 
noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done 
manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that 
he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon 
my companion.
"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did 
you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's 
carpenter."
"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked 
with it, and the muscles are more developed."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
20
"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the 
strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with 
the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
"Well, but China?"
"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done 
in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature 
of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to 
China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter 
becomes even more simple."
Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done 
something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all."
"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum 
pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I 
am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the 
column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
I took the paper from him and read as follows:
"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of 
Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of 
the League to a salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who 
are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in 
person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's 
Court, Fleet Street."
"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary 
announcement.
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off 
the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all 
about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your 
fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago." "Very good. Now, Mr.
Wilson?"
"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his 
forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
21
large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to 
keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is 
willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I 
should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better 
himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I 
put ideas in his head?"
"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employé who comes under the full 
market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that 
your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. 
Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down 
into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the 
whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."
"He is still with you, I presume?"
"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--
that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, 
sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing 
more.
"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the 
office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
"'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.' "'Why that?' I asks.
"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite 
a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than 
there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair 
would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
"'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my 
business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting 
my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I 
was always glad of a bit of news.
"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open. 
"'Never.'
"'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.' "'And what are 
they worth?' I asked.
"'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very 
much with one's other occupations.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
22
"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been 
over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
"'Tell me all about it,' said I.
"'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a 
vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make 
out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very 
peculiar in his ways. He was himself
red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found 
that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the 
interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is 
splendid pay and very little to do.'
"'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'
"'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and 
to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to 
do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is 
light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, 
Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put 
yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'
"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and 
rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood 
as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much 
about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for 
the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the 
business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west 
every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the 
advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a 
coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as 
were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, 
lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who 
had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given 
it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he 
pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps 
which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and 
some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in 
the office."
"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and 
refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting 
statement."
"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which 
sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each

candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would 
disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. 
However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of 
the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot 
recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one 
side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung 
my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking 
an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled 
with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it 
should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by 
paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He 
stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was 
filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in 
different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the 
manager.
"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund 
left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
"I answered that I had not. "His face fell immediately.
"'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The 
fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their 
maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'
"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after 
all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
"'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in 
favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your 
new duties?'
"'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.
"'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after 
that for you.' "'What would be the hours?' I asked.
"'Ten to two.'
"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday 
and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in 
the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to 
anything that turned up.
"'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?' "'Is 4 pounds a week.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
24
"'And the work?' "'Is purely nominal.'
"'What do you call purely nominal?'
"'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you 
forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with 
the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'
"'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.
"'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. 
There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'
"'And the work?'
"'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first volume of it in that press. You 
must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you 
be ready to-morrow?'
"'Certainly,' I answered.
"'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important 
position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I 
went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own 
good fortune.
"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite 
persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its 
object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make 
such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 
'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime 
I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a 
look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of 
foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.
"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out 
ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off 
upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all 
was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount 
that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.
"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked 
down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the 
week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. 
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come 
in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when 
he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk 
the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour 
and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very 
long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. 
And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
"To an end?"
"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door 
was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel 
with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this 
fashion: THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
IS DISSOLVED.
October 9, 1890.
Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the 
comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both 
burst out into a roar of laughter.
"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his 
flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really 
wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will 
excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when 
you found the card upon the door?"
"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of 
them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant 
living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Redheaded League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. 
Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
"'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.' "'What, the red-headed man?'
"'Yes.'
"'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a 
temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
"'Where could I find him?'
"'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial kneecaps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross." "And 
what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
26
"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not 
help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not 
quite good enough, Mr.
Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were 
good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall 
be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues 
hang from it than might at first sight appear."
"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."
"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any 
grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by 
some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every 
subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in 
playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it 
cost them two and thirty pounds."
"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. 
Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long 
had he been with you?"
"About a month then." "How did he come?"
"In answer to an advertisement." "Was he the only applicant?" "No, I had a dozen."
"Why did you pick him?"
"Because he was handy and would come cheap." "At half-wages, in fact."
"Yes."
"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. 
Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you 
ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"
"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad." "Hum!" said Holmes, 
sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?" "Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course 
of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?" "I make 
nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."
"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is 
your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is 
the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to 
me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his 
hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like 
the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and 
indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man 
who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, 
Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."
"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch 
on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is 
rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. 
Come along!"
We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg 
Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, 
little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a 
small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes 
made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a 
brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place 
where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it 
with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between 
puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still 
looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped 
vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and 
knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked 
him to step in.
"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the 
Strand."
"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.
"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth 
smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have 
known something of him before."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Redheaded League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
"Not him." "What then?"
"The knees of his trousers." "And what did you see?" "What I expected to see."
"Why did you beat the pavement?"
"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. 
We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired SaxeCoburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It 
was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The 
roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward 
and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was 
difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they 
really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just 
to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of 
London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of 
the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building 
depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's 
time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is 
sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their 
conundrums."
My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a 
composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most 
perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently 
smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, 
Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to 
conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme 
exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic 
and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took 
him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly 
formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his 
improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would 
suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of 
intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as 
on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so 
enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those 
whom he had set himself to hunt down. "You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he 
remarked as we emerged.
"Yes, it would be as well."
"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is 
serious." "Why serious?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
29
"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in 
time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help tonight."
"At what time?"
"Ten will be early enough."
"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver 
in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among 
the crowd.
I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense 
of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, 
I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only 
what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still 
confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from 
the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to 
Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this 
nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to 
do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable 
man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and 
set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.
It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so 
through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I 
entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found 
Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the 
official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and 
oppressively respectable frock-coat.
"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy 
hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me 
introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our 
friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do 
the running down."
"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather 
gloomily.
"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He 
has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical 
and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once 
or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more 
nearly correct than the official force."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess 
that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not 
had my rubber."
"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than 
you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, 
the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you 
wish to lay your hands."
"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but 
he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any 
criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal 
duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and 
though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll 
crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the 
next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns 
also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past 
ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and 
I will follow in the second."
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab 
humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless 
labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, 
and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not 
a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as 
brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, 
and they are waiting for us."
We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the 
morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we 
passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there 
was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led 
down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. 
Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling 
passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all 
round with crates and massive boxes.
"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and 
gazed about him.
"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. 
"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
31
"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already 
imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness 
to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression 
upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a 
magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds 
sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.
"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the 
good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their 
work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt 
you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. 
Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons 
why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at 
present."
"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt 
might be made upon it."
"Your French gold?"
"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that 
purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never 
had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I 
sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much 
larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had 
misgivings upon the subject."
"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our 
little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. 
Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
"And sit in the dark?"
"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a 
partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations 
have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose
our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they 
may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal 
yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, 
Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. 
Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an 
absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to 
assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my 
nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in 
the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
32
"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into SaxeCoburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."
What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet 
it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. 
My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked 
up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the 
gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the 
bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over 
the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it 
became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a 
hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area 
of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. 
Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid 
spark which marked a chink between the stones.
Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the 
broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which 
streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which 
looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself 
shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood 
at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with 
a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, 
jump, and I'll swing for it!"
Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down 
the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed 
upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the 
pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."
"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though 
I see you have got his coat-tails."
"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you." "And I 
you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I 
am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."
"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the 
handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. 
Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"
"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, 
where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"
"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and 
walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not 
know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and 
defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery 
that have ever come within my experience."
"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I 
have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but 
beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and 
by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of 
whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible 
object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of 
the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a 
number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult 
to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour 
of his accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it 
to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the 
temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to 
secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant 
having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing 
the situation."
"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, 
however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing 
in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as 
they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the 
assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There 
was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found 
that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing 
something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What 
could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some 
other building.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
34
"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the 
pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. 
It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had 
some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. 
His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, 
and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was 
what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank 
abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home 
after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with 
the result that you have seen."
"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.
"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about
Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was 
essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be 
removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days 
for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and 
yet every link rings true."
"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My 
life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little 
problems help me to do so."
"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. 
"'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at 
Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We 
would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we 
could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, 
and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, 
the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading 
to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen 
conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers 
are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to 
its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
35
"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked 
Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the 
platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital 
essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the 
commonplace."
I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in 
your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, 
throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But 
here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is 
the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of 
print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the 
other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The 
crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."
"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper 
and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was 
engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, 
there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the 
habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, 
you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. 
Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."
He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour 
was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon 
it.
"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the 
King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of 
such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one 
or two of my little problems."
"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you 
understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant 
matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect 
which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the 
bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather 
intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which 
presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better 
before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the 
dull
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
36
neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite 
there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather 
in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over 
her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our 
windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her 
glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried 
across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. 
"Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is 
not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may 
discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, 
and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, 
but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in 
person to resolve our doubts."
As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss 
Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed 
merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy 
for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he 
looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much 
typewriting?" "I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without 
looking." Then, suddenly
realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and 
astonishment upon
her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how 
could you know all that?"
"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained 
myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so 
easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you 
would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides 
the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. 
Hosmer Angel."
"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his 
finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I 
did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. 
Windibank--that is, my
father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as 
he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I 
just on with my things and came right away to you."
"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
37
"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and 
two months older than myself."
"And your mother is alive?"
"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again 
so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. 
Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, 
which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made 
her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got 4700 pounds 
for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had 
been alive."
I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential 
narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"
"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New 
Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I 
can only touch the interest."
"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a 
year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in 
every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60 
pounds."
"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at 
home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I 
am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my 
interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I 
earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty 
sheets in a day."
"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, 
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your 
connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I 
met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was 
alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did 
not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so 
much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what 
right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends 
were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I 
had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off 
to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used 
to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
38
"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very 
annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and 
said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer 
Angel."
"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and 
after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that 
father came back again, and Mr.
Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more." "No?"
"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could 
help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I 
used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine 
yet."
"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"
"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would 
be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, 
and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for 
father to know."
"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--
was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"
"What office?"
"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know." "Where did he live, then?"
"He slept on the premises."
"And you don't know his address?"
"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street." "Where did you address your letters, then?"
"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to 
the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I 
offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I 
wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that 
the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. 
Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
39
"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things 
are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer 
Angel?"
"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the 
daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. 
Even his voice was gentle.
He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him 
with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, 
very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses 
against the glare."
"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"
"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father 
came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, 
that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make 
me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and 
was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I 
began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him 
afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr.
Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; 
but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the 
company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the 
wedding."
"It missed him, then?"
"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in 
church?"
"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have 
breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there 
were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened 
to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler 
drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from 
the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what 
had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. 
Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what 
became of him."
"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.
"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to 
me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen 
occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
40
would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what 
has happened since gives a meaning to it."
"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has 
occurred to him?"
"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I 
think that what he foresaw happened."
"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?" "None."
"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again." "And your father? Did 
you tell him?"
"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of 
Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the 
church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and 
got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent 
about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? 
And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at 
night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.
"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall 
reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your 
mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as 
he has done from your life."
"Then you don't think I'll see him again?" "I fear not."
"Then what has happened to him?"
"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any 
letters of his which you can spare."
"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four 
letters from him."
"Thank you. And your address?" "No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?" 
"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."
"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and 
remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do 
not allow it to affect your life."
"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me 
ready when he comes back."
For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple 
faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the 
table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs 
stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down 
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he 
leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of 
infinite languor in his face.
"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her 
little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult 
my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as 
is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden 
herself was most instructive."
"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.
"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all 
that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the 
suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what 
did you gather from that woman's appearance?
Describe it."
"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her 
jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her 
dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and 
sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I 
didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings,and a general air of being fairly wellto-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way." Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly 
together and chuckled.
"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well 
indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the 
method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but 
concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is 
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush 
upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little 
above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.
The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on 
the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this 
was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, 
I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."
"It surprised me."
"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to 
observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were 
really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was 
buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. 
Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home 
with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
42
"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.
"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully 
dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not 
apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a 
hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not 
remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back 
to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer 
Angel?"
I held the little printed slip to the light.
"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 
five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the 
centre, bushy, black
side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last 
seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris 
tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in 
an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are 
very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. 
There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."
"They are typewritten," I remarked.
"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the 
bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is 
rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive --in fact, we may call it 
conclusive."
"Of what?"
"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"
"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action 
for breach of promise were instituted."
"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. 
One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking 
him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we 
should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the 
answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the 
interim."
I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and 
extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured 
and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called 
upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, 
and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be 
a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on 
the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the 
identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole 
of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I 
found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid 
that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock 
Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his 
armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of 
hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was s o dear to 
him.
"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered. "Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in 
the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is 
that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"
The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, 
when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.
"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say 
that he would be here at six. Come in!"
The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, cleanshaven, and
sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and 
penetrating grey eyes.
He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and 
with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from 
you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"
"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am 
sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better 
not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is 
a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when 
she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not 
connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
44
noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer 
Angel?"
"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in 
discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.
"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much 
individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly 
alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you 
remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over 
of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but 
those are the more obvious."
"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," 
our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes 
continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter 
and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have 
here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each 
case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use 
my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as 
well."
Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort 
of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know 
when you have done it."
"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, 
that I have caught him!"
"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a 
rat in a trap.
"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, 
Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said 
that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk 
it over."
Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--
it's not actionable," he stammered.
"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and 
selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over 
the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
45
The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly 
crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his 
hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he 
enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a 
considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious 
difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable 
disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her 
fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. 
Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her 
stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding 
her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not 
answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her 
positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He 
conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and 
assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked 
the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an 
insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. 
Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."
"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been 
so carried away."
"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, 
having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery 
never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the 
effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began 
to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect 
were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure 
the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up 
forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly 
to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent 
impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for 
some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the 
allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James 
Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his 
fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the 
church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished 
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think 
that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"
Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he 
rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.
"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be 
sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done 
nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself 
open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
46
"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, 
"yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or 
a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at 
the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but 
here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to 
the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the 
heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at 
the top of his speed down the road.
"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his 
chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, 
and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."
"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.
"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some 
strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really 
profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two 
men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was 
suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, 
as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in 
typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her 
that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, 
together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."
"And how did you verify them?"
"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this 
man worked.
Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result 
of a
disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they 
would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already 
noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business 
address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and 
revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from 
Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect 
with that of their employé, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"
"And Miss Sutherland?"
"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger 
for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a 
woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. 
It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:
"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in 
connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and 
scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?" "I really don't know 
what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."
"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think 
that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' 
cases."
"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. 
"But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."
My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt 
and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in 
a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and 
down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey 
travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to 
me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either 
worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."
We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had 
brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of 
meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball 
and tossed them up onto the rack.
"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked. "Not a word. I have not seen a paper for 
some days."
"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the 
recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of 
those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
"That sounds a little paradoxical."
"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and 
commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they 
have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."
"It is a murder, then?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
48
"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of 
looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to 
understand it, in a very few words.
"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest 
landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and 
returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, 
was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each 
other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they 
should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so 
McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as 
they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an 
only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have 
avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though 
both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the 
neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have 
been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.
"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the 
afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the 
spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his 
serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an 
appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.
"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw 
him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and 
the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these 
witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a 
few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going 
the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight 
at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in 
the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost 
sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of 
reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodgekeeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that 
while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy 
and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the 
elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to 
strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother 
when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, 
and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when 
young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in 
the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his 
gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On 
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
49
The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries 
were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was 
found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young 
man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest 
on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred 
the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the 
coroner and the police-court."
"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence 
pointed to a criminal it does so here."
"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to 
point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it 
pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be 
confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very 
possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, 
and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his 
innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the 
Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has 
referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at 
fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."
"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out 
of this case."
"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we 
may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to 
Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either 
confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of 
understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom 
the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have 
noted even so self-evident a thing as that."
"How on earth--"
"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You 
shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less 
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as 
we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than 
the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and 
being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and 
inference. Therein lies my métier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the
investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out 
in the inquest, and which are worth considering."
"What are they?"
"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On 
the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
50
not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had 
the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of 
the coroner's jury."
"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious 
remark."
"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. 
However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that 
the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or 
feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such 
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be 
the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an 
innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark 
about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body 
of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty 
as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so 
important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are 
displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty 
one."
I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked. "So they 
have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in 
it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down 
the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own 
statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it 
very carefully. It ran in this way:
"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as 
follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon 
the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my 
arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the 
groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my 
window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which 
direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe 
Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I 
saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in 
thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a 
hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my 
father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
51
be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A 
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a 
very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and 
returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard 
a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring 
upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but 
he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. 
Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my 
father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular 
man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no 
active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died? "Witness: He 
mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat. "The Coroner: What did 
you understand by that?
"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.
"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel? 
"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with 
the sad tragedy which followed.
"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to 
answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
"Witness: I must still refuse.
"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your 
father? "Witness: It was.
"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew 
that you had returned from Bristol?
"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing 
the cry and found your father fatally injured?
"Witness: Nothing definite.
"The Coroner: What do you mean?
"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of 
nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay 
upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of 
some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.
"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?' "'Yes, it was gone.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
52
"'You cannot say what it was?'
"'No, I had a feeling something was there.' "'How far from the body?'
"'A dozen yards or so.'
"'And how far from the edge of the wood?' "'About the same.'
"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?' "'Yes, but with my 
back towards it.'
"This concluded the examination of the witness."
"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was 
rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy 
about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of 
his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are 
all, as he remarks, very much against the son."
Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you 
and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in 
the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much 
imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give 
him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness 
anything so outré as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I 
shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we 
shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not 
another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, 
and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."
It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, 
and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. 
A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of 
the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic 
surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising
Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already 
been engaged for us.
"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic 
nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of 
barometric pressure."
Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of 
cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country 
hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."
Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the 
newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
53
plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. 
She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was 
nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her 
carriage at the door."
He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women 
that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her 
cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a 
woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I 
have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start 
upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each 
other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too 
tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all 
that I can."
"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some 
loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"
"I think that it is very probable."
"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! 
He gives me hopes."
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in 
forming his conclusions," he said.
"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his 
father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I 
was concerned in it."
"In what way?" asked Holmes.
"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. 
Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have 
always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little 
of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were 
quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"
"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush 
passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?" "I am 
afraid the doctor won't allow it."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
54
"The doctor?"
"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken 
him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that 
his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in 
the old days in Victoria."
"Ha! In Victoria! That is important." "Yes, at the mines."
"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money." "Yes, 
certainly."
"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."
"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see 
James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."
"I will, Miss Turner."
"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God 
help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, 
and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why 
should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, 
but I call it cruel."
"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see
him in prison?"
"Yes, but only for you and me."
"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to 
Hereford and see him to-night?"
"Ample."
"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a 
couple of hours."
I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little 
town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a 
yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the 
deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually 
from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to 
a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were 
absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity 
could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, 
drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. 
What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical 
instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
55
account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the 
left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow 
from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have 
been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen 
quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older 
man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call 
Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that 
mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become 
delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what 
could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the 
incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have 
dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the 
hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back 
turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing 
was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' 
insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his 
conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.
It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in 
lodgings in the town.
"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should 
not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his 
very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a 
long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."
"And what did you learn from him?" "Nothing."
"Could he throw no light?"
"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was 
screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a 
very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."
"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage 
with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."
"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but 
some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been 
away five years at a
boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and 
marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how 
maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to 
do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made 
him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on 
to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his 
father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he 
known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, 
and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come 
out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
56
likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a 
husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think 
that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered."
"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered 
man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have 
been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is 
that the murdered man was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. 
Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.
And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters 
until to-morrow."
There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine 
o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the 
Boscombe Pool.
"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, 
is so ill that his life is despaired of."
"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in 
failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old 
friend of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave 
him Hatherley Farm rent free."
"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his 
kindness to him."
"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had 
little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying 
his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very 
cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the 
more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us 
as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"
"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it 
hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle the facts."
"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of," replied 
Lestrade with some warmth.
"And that is--"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
57
"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary 
are the merest moonshine."
"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much 
mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left."
"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, 
with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless 
chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy 
upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which 
her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son's, though not the pair which 
he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, 
Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which 
led to Boscombe Pool.
Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had 
only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. 
His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes 
shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders 
bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His 
nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely 
concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his 
ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he 
made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to 
the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of 
many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. 
Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little 
detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and 
contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction 
that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.
The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated 
at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. 
Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles 
which marked the site of the rich landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the 
woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across 
between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the 
exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I 
could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I 
could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the 
trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my 
companion.
"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on 
earth--"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
58
"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A 
mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have 
been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is 
where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight 
feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet." He drew out a lens 
and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself 
than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so 
that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran 
when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father's feet as he paced up and 
down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, 
ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes!
Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for 
the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes 
finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a 
great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of 
this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he 
remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to 
be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of 
the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he 
carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came 
to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I 
fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a 
word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our 
luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently."
It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still 
carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.
"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "The murder was done with it." 
"I see no marks."
"There are none."
"How do you know, then?"
"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place 
whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other 
weapon."
"And the murderer?"
"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey 
cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. 
There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."
Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are all very well, but 
we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
59
"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I 
shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
"And leave your case unfinished?" "No, finished."
"But the mystery?" "It is solved."
"Who was the criminal, then?" "The gentleman I describe." "But who is he?"
"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said, "and I really cannot undertake 
to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become 
the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. 
I shall drop you a line before I leave."
Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. 
Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who 
finds himself in a perplexing position.
"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair and let me 
preach to you for a little. I don't know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a 
cigar and let me expound."
"Pray do so."
"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative 
which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. 
One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing 
him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you 
understand, but that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double point our research 
must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in 
Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the 
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly 
Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that 
the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had 
been in Australia."
"What of the rat, then?"
Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. "This is a 
map of the Colony of Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over 
part of the map. "What do you read?"
"ARAT," I read.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
60
"And now?" He raised his hand. "BALLARAT."
"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two 
syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of 
a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a 
certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an 
Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
"Certainly."
"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or 
by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander."
"Quite so."
"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling 
details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
"But how did you gain them?"
"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles."
"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, 
might be told from their traces."
"Yes, they were peculiar boots." "But his lameness?"
"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon 
it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."
"But his left-handedness."
"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. 
The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can 
that be unless it were by a
left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and 
son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of 
tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some 
attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, 
cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the 
stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are 
rolled in Rotterdam."
"And the cigar-holder?"
"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had 
been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
61
"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you 
have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I 
see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in 
a visitor.
The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed 
shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, 
and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of 
character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to 
give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his 
lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a 
glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"
"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid 
scandal." "I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion with despair in his 
weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It is so. I know all about 
McCarthy."
The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not have let the 
young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against 
him at the Assizes."
"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will 
break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."
"It may not come to that," said Holmes. "What?"
"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, 
and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a 
question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before 
him. "Just tell us the truth," he said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here 
can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young 
McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
62
"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters 
little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to 
you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep 
you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and 
he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, 
ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck 
with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a 
highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station 
from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat 
was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat 
Gang.
"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and 
attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of 
their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. 
I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the 
Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my 
face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, 
and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals 
and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which 
chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for 
the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my 
dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the 
right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to 
make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat 
to his back or a boot to his foot.
"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. 
There's two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine, 
law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman within hail.'
"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they 
have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no 
forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew 
worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the 
police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, 
land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it 
seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was 
firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, 
but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him 
to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited 
behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter 
in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little 
regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to 
think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I 
not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly 
strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be 
saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I 
have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled 
in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no 
more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his 
son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak 
which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred."
"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which 
had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."
"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for 
your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is 
condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your 
secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us."
"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the 
easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all 
his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks with poor, 
helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and 
say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"
James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which 
had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for 
seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son 
and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests 
upon their past.
ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years '82 
and '90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy 
matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained 
publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities 
which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to 
illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
64
without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations 
founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so 
dear to him.
There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its 
results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in 
connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain 
the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the 
adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious 
club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the 
British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island 
of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, 
Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to prove that it had been 
wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time-
-a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may 
sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange 
train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional 
violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that 
even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the 
instant from the routine of 
life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind 
through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm 
grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock 
Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at 
the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from 
without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long 
swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a few days I was a 
dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the bell. Who could come tonight? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."
"A client, then?"
"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an 
hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage 
and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself 
and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
"Come in!" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
65
The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and 
trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella 
which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through 
which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see 
that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some 
great anxiety.
"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not 
intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."
"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on the hook and will be 
dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see."
"Yes, from Horsham."
"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive." "I have come 
for advice."
"That is easily got." "And help."
"That is not always so easy."
"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the 
Tankerville Club scandal."
"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards." "He said that you could solve 
anything."
"He said too much."
"That you are never beaten."
"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman." "But what is that 
compared with the number of your successes?"
"It is true that I have been generally successful."
"Then you may be so with me."
"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your 
case." "It is no ordinary one."
"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal."
"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more 
mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own 
family."
"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential facts from the 
commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be 
most important."
The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
66
"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, 
little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of 
the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.
"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My 
father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of 
bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such 
success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.
"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in 
Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in 
Jackson's army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid 
down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. 
About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. 
He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his 
aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to 
them.
He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and 
of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he 
set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he 
would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He 
drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not 
want any friends, not even his own brother.
"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a 
youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years 
in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. 
When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he 
would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by 
the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go 
where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one 
singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, 
which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to 
enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see 
more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.
"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the 
colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in 
ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 
'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little 
dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh 
was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his 
skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, 
'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with 
horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
67
gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What 
could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the 
stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in 
one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that 
I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire 
was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned 
paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, 
with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon 
the envelope.
"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages 
and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. 
If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and 
leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say 
what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident 
made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it 
every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the 
vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks 
passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in 
my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. 
Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but 
sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and 
tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, 
and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits 
were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, 
like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. 
At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were 
new raised from a basin.
"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there 
came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We 
found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, 
which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but 
two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of 
'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to 
persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and 
my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his 
credit at the bank."
"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable 
to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, 
and the date of his supposed suicide."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
68
"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 
2nd."
"Thank you. Pray proceed."
"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful 
examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, 
although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with 
the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' 
written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been 
destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the 
attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in 
America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and 
had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the 
Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong 
part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well 
as possible with us until the January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my 
father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, 
sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the 
outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull 
story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had 
come upon himself.
"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered. "My heart had turned to lead. 'It is 
K. K. K.,' said I.
"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are the very letters. But what is this 
written above them?'
"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder. "'What papers? What 
sundial?' he asked.
"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the papers must be those that are 
destroyed.'
"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, and we can't have 
tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?'
"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I 
shall take no notice of such nonsense.'
"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.' "'Then let me do so?'
"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such nonsense.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
69
"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with 
a heart which was full of forebodings.
"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend 
of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad 
that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away 
from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a 
telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the 
deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered 
skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He 
had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was 
unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict 
of 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I 
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of 
violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. 
And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain 
that some foul plot had been woven round him.
"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I 
answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an 
incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.
"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have 
elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope 
that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. 
I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very 
shape in which it had come upon my father."
The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook 
out upon it five little dried orange pips.
"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the 
very words which were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on 
the sundial.'"
"What have you done?" asked Holmes. "Nothing."
"Nothing?"
"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt 
like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of 
some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against."
"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can 
save you. This is no time for despair."
"I have seen the police." "Ah!"
"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the 
opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really 
accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
70
Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.
"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me."
"Has he come with you to-night?"
"No. His orders were to stay in the house." Again Holmes raved in the air.
"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not come at once?"
"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and 
was advised by him to come to you."
"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no 
further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail 
which might help us?"
"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a 
piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some 
remembrance," said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the 
small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this 
single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the 
papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped 
destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that 
it is a page from some private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."
Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which showed by its 
ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and 
beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St. Augustine. "9th. McCauley 
cleared.
"10th. John Swain cleared.
"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor. "And now you 
must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have 
told me. You must get home instantly and act."
"What shall I do?"
"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece of paper which 
you have shown us into the brass box which you have described. You must also put in a note to 
say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one which 
remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them. Having done 
this, you must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
71
"Entirely."
"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by 
means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first 
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up 
the mystery and to punish the guilty parties."
"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. "You have given me fresh 
life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."
"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think 
that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do 
you go back?"
"By train from Waterloo."
"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you 
cannot guard yourself too closely."
"I am armed."
"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case." "I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."
"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I 
shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside 
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, 
wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a 
sheet of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.
Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent 
upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the 
blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic 
than this." "Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid 
even greater perils than did the Sholtos."
"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?" "There 
can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?"
Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his 
finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown 
a single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it 
but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
72
animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood 
one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both 
before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to. 
Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution 
by the aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the 
reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in 
itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of 
free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, 
however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his 
work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, 
in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."
"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics 
were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains 
from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy uns ystematic, 
sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and 
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."
Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a man should 
keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he 
can put away in the
lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one 
which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly 
hand me down the letter K of the 'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside 
you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the 
first place, we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very 
strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and 
exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial 
town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone 
or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or 
something which drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce 
that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors. 
Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?"
"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London." "From 
East London. What do you deduce from that?"
"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability--the strong 
probability--is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In 
the case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee 
it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"
"A greater distance to travel."
"But the letter had also a greater distance to come." "Then I do not see the point."
"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing -ship. It 
looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
73
their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If 
they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their 
letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks 
represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing 
vessel which brought the writer."
"It is possible."
"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why 
I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it 
would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore 
we cannot count upon delay."
"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"
"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or 
persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of 
them. A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a 
coroner's jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men of resource 
and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may. In this 
way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a 
society."
"But of what society?"
"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his voice--"have you 
never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
"I never have."
Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:
"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking 
a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern 
states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, 
notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for 
political purposes, principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and 
driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually 
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised 
shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving 
this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he 
braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange 
and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the society, and so systematic its 
methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with 
impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For some years 
the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the 
better classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement 
rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since 
that date.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
74
"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the sudden breaking up of the 
society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It 
may well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the 
more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register and diary may 
implicate some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many who will not sleep 
easy at night until it is recovered."
"Then the page we have seen--"
"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, 
sent the society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or 
left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, 
Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young 
Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said 
or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the 
miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow-men."
It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the 
dim veil which hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came 
down.
"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I foresee, a very busy day before 
me in looking into this case of young Openshaw's."
"What steps will you take?" I asked.
"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to 
Horsham, after all." "You will not go there first?"
"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee."
As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It 
rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.
"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I 
could see that he was deeply moved.
"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here 
is the account:
"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near 
Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was 
extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite 
impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the waterpolice, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman whose 
name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
75
whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to 
catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he 
missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river 
steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that the 
deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of 
calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside
landing-stages."
We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen 
him.
"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my 
pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my 
hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to 
his death--!" He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, 
with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin 
hands.
"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they have decoyed him down 
there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too 
crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in 
the long run. I am going out now!"
"To the police?"
"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not 
before."
All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned 
to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he 
entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the 
loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.
"You are hungry," I remarked.
"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast." "Nothing?"
"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it." "And how have you succeeded?" "Well."
"You have a clue?"
"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. 
Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
"What do you mean?"
He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon 
the table. Of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he 
wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque 
'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
76
"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. 
He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first." "How did you trace it, then?"
He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.
"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers and files of the old papers, 
following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and 
February in '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during 
those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,' instantly attracted my attention, since, although it 
was reported as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to one of the 
states of the Union."
"Texas, I think."
"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin." 
"What then?"
"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque 'Lone Star' was there in 
January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at 
present in the port of London."
"Yes?"
"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she 
had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I 
wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly 
I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
"What will you do, then?"
"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born 
Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three 
away from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By 
the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and 
the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly 
wanted here upon a charge of murder."
There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John 
Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as 
cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were 
the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but 
none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered 
stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved 
upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."

ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St. 
George's, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some 
foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description of his dreams 
and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the 
same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to 
get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled 
horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping 
lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives 
his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work 
down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our 
own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the 
room.
"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she 
ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in 
such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had 
not an idea who you were when you came in."
"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always the way. Folk who were 
in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.
"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here 
comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for 
two days. I am so frightened about him!"
It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, 
to my wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such 
words as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could 
bring him back to her?
It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on 
him, made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always 
been confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But 
now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
78
dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be 
found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? 
How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her 
husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this 
place? And then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical 
adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I 
promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were 
indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair 
and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange 
errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was 
to be.
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a 
vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of 
London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps 
leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search. 
Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless 
tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch 
and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and 
terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, 
bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and 
there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there 
glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or 
waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, 
and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in 
gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and 
paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of
burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, 
with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into the fire.
As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the 
drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, 
and I wish to speak with him."
There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I 
saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.
"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a 
twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"
"Nearly eleven." "Of what day?"
"Of Friday, June 19th."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
79
"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a 
chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be 
ashamed of yourself!"
"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four 
pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. 
Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
"Yes, I have one waiting."
"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I 
can do nothing for myself."
I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to 
keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed 
the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, 
"Walk past me, and then look back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I 
glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as 
absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from 
between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two 
steps forward and looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into 
a cry of astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had 
filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the 
fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight 
motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the company 
once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you would have the great kindness 
to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with 
you."
"I have a cab outside."
"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get 
into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to 
say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five 
minutes."
It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly 
definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney 
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could 
not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular 
adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a few minutes I had written my 
note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a 
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking down the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
80
street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an 
uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a 
hearty fit of laughter.
"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine 
injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your 
medical views."
"I was certainly surprised to find you there." "But not more so than I to find you."
"I came to find a friend." "And I to find an enemy." "An enemy?"
"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the 
midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings 
of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not 
have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and 
the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at 
the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of 
what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."
"What! You do not mean bodies?"
"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds for every poor devil who 
has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I 
fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He 
put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by 
a similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of 
horses' hoofs.
"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two 
golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
"If I can be of use."
"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is 
a double-bedded one."
"The Cedars?"
"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry." "Where is it, 
then?"
"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us." "But I am all in the dark."
"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not 
need you.
Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, 
then!"
He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of 
sombre and deserted streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad 
balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
81
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of the 
policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting 
slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the 
clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is 
lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which 
seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. 
We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban 
villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man 
who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a 
companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own 
thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman tonight when she meets me at the door."
"You forget that I know nothing about it."
"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly 
simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but 
I can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case clearly and concisely to you, 
Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."
"Proceed, then."
"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair 
by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds 
very nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, 
and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He 
had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the 
morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven 
years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a 
man who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present 
moment, as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while he has 220 
pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to 
think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before 
he started that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his 
little boy home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon 
this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect that a small parcel of 
considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the 
Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the 
office of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where 
you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, 
proceeded to the company's office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking 
through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me so far?"
"It is very clear."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
82
"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, 
glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she 
found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an 
ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and, as it 
seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she 
distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands 
frantically to her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he 
had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck 
her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to 
town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
"Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps--for the house was 
none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night--and running through the front 
room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, 
however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided 
by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most 
maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in 
Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The 
inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the 
proprietor, they made their way to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There 
was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a 
crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar 
stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined 
was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. 
Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the 
table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which 
he had promised to bring home.
"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector 
realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed 
to an abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a 
small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and 
the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with 
at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from 
below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several 
scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a 
curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his 
coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were there. There were no signs of violence 
upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the 
window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous 
bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the 
tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.
"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar 
was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known 
to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband's appearance at 
the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was 
one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the 
missing gentleman's clothes.
"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor 
of the opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville 
St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man 
who goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police 
regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle 
Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. 
Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on 
his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather 
cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once 
before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the 
harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no 
one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a 
horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog 
chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of 
his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his 
wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the 
passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and 
to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of 
life?"
"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a 
powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that 
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."
"Pray continue your narrative."
"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, and she was escorted 
home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations. 
Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the 
premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake 
had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during 
which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon 
remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which could 
incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he 
pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding 
came from there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the stains 
which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously 
having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room 
was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had 
actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either
mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector 
remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was 
Neville St. Clair's coat, and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And 
what do you think they found in the pockets?"
"I cannot imagine."
"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies--421 
pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. 
But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the 
house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body 
had been sucked away into the river."
"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body be 
dressed in a coat alone?"
"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone had thrust 
Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed. 
What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the telltale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it 
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the 
scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard 
from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to 
be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, 
and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the 
coat's sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had 
not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the 
police appeared."
"It certainly sounds feasible."
"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you, 
was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before 
been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life 
appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and 
the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what 
happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his 
disappearance--are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case 
within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such 
difficulties."
While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events, we had been whirling 
through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, 
and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished, however, 
we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have touched on three English 
counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in 
Kent. See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman 
whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
85
"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I asked.
"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly 
put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a 
welcome for my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her 
husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had 
run out to the horse's head, and springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding 
gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde 
woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of 
fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of 
light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her 
head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.
"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two of us, she gave a cry of hope 
which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his 
shoulders.
"No good news?" "None."
"No bad?"
"No."
"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day."
"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a 
lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this 
investigation."
"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive 
anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has 
come so suddenly upon us."
"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that no 
apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be 
indeed happy."
"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table 
of which a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain 
questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain answer."
"Certainly, madam."
"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to 
hear your real, real opinion."
"Upon what point?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
86
"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, 
standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
"Frankly, then, madam, I do not." "You think that he is dead?"
"I do." "Murdered?"
"I don't say that. Perhaps."
"And on what day did he meet his death?" "On Monday."
"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a 
letter from him to-day."
Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised. "What!" he roared.
"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air. "May I see it?"
"Certainly."
He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the 
lamp and examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The 
envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the 
date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was considerably after midnight.
"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam." "No, 
but the enclosure is."
"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address." 
"How can you tell that?"
"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish 
colour, which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and 
then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there 
has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not 
familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now 
see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"
"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
"And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?" "One of his hands."
"One?"
"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it well."
"'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take some 
little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book, 
octavo size, no
water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap 
has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. 
And you have no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"
"None. Neville wrote those words."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
87
"And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I 
should not venture to say that the danger is over."
"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. 
It may have been taken from him."
"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
"Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day." "That is 
possible."
"If so, much may have happened between."
"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen 
a sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw 
him last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly 
with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to 
such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
"I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than 
the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece 
of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why 
should he remain away from you?"
"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
"And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?" "No."
"And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?" "Very much so."
"Was the window open?" "Yes."
"Then he might have called to you?" "He might."
"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?" "Yes."
"A call for help, you thought?" "Yes. He waved his hands."
"But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might 
cause him to throw up his hands?"
"It is possible."
"And you thought he was pulled back?" "He disappeared so suddenly."
"He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?"
"No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of 
the stairs." "Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"
"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat." "Had he ever spoken of Swandam 
Lane?"
"Never."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
88
"Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?" "Never."
"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely 
clear. We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day tomorrow."
A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was 
quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a 
man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and 
even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every 
point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were 
insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He 
took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about 
the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these 
he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an 
ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In the dim light of the lamp 
I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the 
corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light 
shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat 
when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the 
apartment. The pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was 
full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon 
the previous night.
"Awake, Watson?" he asked. "Yes."
"Game for a morning drive?" "Certainly."
"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon 
have the trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a 
different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twentyfive minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy 
was putting in the horse.
"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you 
are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be 
kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now."
"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look of 
incredulity. "I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone 
bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock."
We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. 
In the road stood our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We 
both sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, 
bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and 
lifeless as some city in a dream.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
89
"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I 
confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to 
learn it at all."
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove 
through the streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over 
the river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in 
Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force, and the two constables at the door 
saluted him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes. "Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, 
in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet." 
"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, with a huge 
ledger upon the table, and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
desk.
"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged with being concerned in the 
disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee."
"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries." "So I heard. You have him here?"
"In the cells." "Is he quiet?"
"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel." "Dirty?"
"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, 
when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw 
him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
"I should like to see him very much."
"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag." "No, I think that I'll 
take it."
"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, 
passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on 
each side.
"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the 
upper part of the door and glanced through.
"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep 
sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his 
calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the 
inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its 
repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its 
contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a 
perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, and I took the 
liberty of bringing the tools with me." He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, 
to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make 
him cut a much more respectable figure."
"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to the Bow Street 
cells, does he?" He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The 
sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to 
the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the 
prisoner's face.
"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of Kent."
Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled off under the sponge like the 
bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had 
seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch 
brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, 
refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him 
with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and 
threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the 
photograph."
The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it 
so," said he. "And pray what am I charged with?"
"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged with that unless they 
make a case of attempted suicide of it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been 
twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, 
therefore, I am illegally detained."
"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would have done 
better to have trusted you wife."
"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner. "God help me, I would not have 
them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said he, "of course you can hardly avoid 
publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case 
against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into 
the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might 
tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all."
"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have endured imprisonment, ay, 
even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, 
where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally 
became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series 
of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the 
point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I 
could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all 
the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage 
now of my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a 
good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured 
plaster.
Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of 
the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, 
and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less 
than 26s. 4d.
"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill 
for a friend and had a writ served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get 
the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from the creditor, asked 
for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. 
In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at 2 pounds a week 
when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying 
my cap on the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but 
the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had 
first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man 
knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, 
where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself 
into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so 
that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.
"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any 
beggar in the streets of London could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average 
takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of 
repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All 
day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which 
I failed to take 2 pounds.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, 
without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had 
business in the City. She little knew what.
"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den 
when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was 
standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my 
arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent 
anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not 
ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and 
wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that 
there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the 
window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom 
that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just 
transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the 
window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at 
that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, 
rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was 
arrested as his murderer.
"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my 
disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife 
would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when 
no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause 
to fear."
"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes. "Good God! What a week she must have 
spent!"
"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand 
that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor 
customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never 
been prosecuted for begging?"
"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there 
must be no more of Hugh Boone."
"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found 
again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you 
for having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."
"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of 
shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

ADVENTURE VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with 
the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a 
purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled 
morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, 
and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse 
for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair 
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.
"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a 
perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points 
in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction."
I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost 
had set in, and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, 
homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is the clue which will 
guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of those whimsical little 
incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other 
within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of 
humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and many a 
little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We 
have already had experience of such."
"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three have 
been entirely free of any legal crime."
"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of 
Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no 
doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the 
commissionaire?"
"Yes."
"It is to him that this trophy belongs." "It is his hat."
"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered 
billycock but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon 
Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at 
this moment in front of Peterson's fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas 
morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small 
jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he 
saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose 
slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
94
this stranger and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man's hat, on which
he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window 
behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the 
man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in uniform 
rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of 
small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the 
appearance of Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the 
spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon 
a small card which was tied to the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H. B.' are 
legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some 
hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of 
them."
"What, then, did Peterson do?"
"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the 
smallest problems are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there 
were signs that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without 
unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a 
goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas 
dinner."
"Did he not advertise?" "No."
"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?" "Only as much as we can deduce."
"From his hat?" "Precisely."
"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"
"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of 
the man who has worn this article?"
I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary 
black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of 
red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had 
remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hatsecurer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted 
in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured 
patches by smearing them with ink.
"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you 
see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."
"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
95
He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of 
him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there are a 
few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong 
balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face 
of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now 
fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral 
retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil 
influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his 
wife has ceased to love him."
"My dear Holmes!"
"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he continued, disregarding my 
remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, 
is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he 
anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his 
hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."
"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to 
see how they are attained?"
"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For 
example, how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?"
For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled 
upon the bridge of his nose. "It is a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a 
brain must have something in it."
"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the 
very best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could 
afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has 
assuredly gone down in the world."
"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral 
retrogression?"
Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting his finger upon the little disc 
and loop of the hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign 
of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against 
the wind. But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is 
obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening 
nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt 
by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his
self-respect."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
96
"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, 
and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part 
of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the 
barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, 
you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, 
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon 
the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly 
be in the best of training."
"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's 
accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I 
shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."
"But he might be a bachelor."
"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon 
the bird's leg."
"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on 
in his house?"
"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think 
that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with 
burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle 
in the other. Anyhow, he never got
tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no 
crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a 
waste of energy."
Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the 
commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is 
dazed with astonishment.
"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?" 
Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand and displayed upon 
the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, 
but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his 
hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
97
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove 
indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?"
"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty." "It's more than a 
precious stone. It is the precious stone."
"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement 
about it in The Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be 
conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly not within a twentieth part of 
the market price."
"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and 
stared from one to the other of us.
"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the 
background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but 
recover the gem."
"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.
"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of 
having abstracted it from the lady's jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the 
case has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe." He 
rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, 
doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the 
charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar 
the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, 
gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the 
Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of 
the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been 
called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been 
forced open, and that the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the 
Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder 
instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not 
be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess, 
deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having 
rushed into the room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector 
Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and 
protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery 
having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the 
offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during 
the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court."
"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. "The 
question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one 
end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
98
deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect. Here is 
the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the 
gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So 
now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part 
he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these 
lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to 
other methods."
"What will you say?"
"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a 
goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening 
at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
"Very. But will he see it?"
"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. 
He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of 
Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted 
the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will 
cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, 
Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers."
"In which, sir?"
"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, and any others 
that occur to you."
"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way 
back and leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the 
one which your family is now devouring."
When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. 
"It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and 
focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels 
every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in 
the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic 
of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has 
already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and 
several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. 
Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? I'll 
lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?" "I cannot tell."
"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the 
matter?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
99
"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no 
idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of 
solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our 
advertisement."
"And you can do nothing until then?" "Nothing."
"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the 
hour you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of 
recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker 
Street once more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat 
which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown 
from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to 
Holmes' room.
"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the 
easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. 
Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for 
winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, 
sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a 
slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black 
frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists 
protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, 
choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and 
letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an 
advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not 
advertise."
Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as 
they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had 
carried off both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt 
at recovering them."
"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it."
"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other 
goose upon the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your 
purpose equally well?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
100
"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.
"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you wish--"
The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," said 
he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance 
are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to 
the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard."
Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.
"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the way, would it bore you to tell me 
where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a 
better grown goose."
"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm. 
"There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in 
the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by 
name, instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence every week, we 
were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the rest is familiar to 
you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my 
gravity." With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off 
upon his way.
"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him. "It is 
quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
"Not particularly."
"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still 
hot." "By all means."
It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, 
the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into 
smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through 
the doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into 
Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small 
public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed 
open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, whiteaproned landlord.
"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he. "My geese!" The man 
seemed surprised.
"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member of your 
goose club." "Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
"Indeed! Whose, then?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
101
"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden." "Indeed? I know some of them. 
Which was it?"
"Breckinridge is his name."
"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord, and prosperity to your house. 
Good-night."
"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty 
air. "Remember, Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this 
chain, we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we 
can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any 
case, we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police, and which a singular
chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, 
and quick march!"
We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent 
Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the 
proprietor a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to 
put up the shutters.
"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the bare slabs of marble. "Let you 
have five hundred to-morrow morning."
"That's no good."
"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare." "Ah, but I was recommended to you."
"Who by?"
"The landlord of the Alpha."
"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.
"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo, "what are you driving 
at? Let's have it straight, now."
"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the 
Alpha." "Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you should be so warm over such a 
trifle."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
102
"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for 
a good article there should be an end of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who 
did you sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One would think they were 
the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over them."
"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries," said 
Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my 
opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred."
"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped the salesman. "It's nothing of 
the kind."
"I say it is."
"I don't believe it."
"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them ever since I was a 
nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred."
"You'll never persuade me to believe that." "Will you bet, then?"
"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I'll have a sovereign on with you, 
just to teach you not to be obstinate."
The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said he.
The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one, laying them 
out together beneath the hanging lamp.
"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I was out of geese, but before I 
finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
"Well?"
"That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are the 
country folk, and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. 
Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town suppliers. Now, 
look at that third name. Just read it out to me."
"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes. "Quite so. Now turn that up in the 
ledger."
Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and 
poultry supplier.'"
"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'" "Quite so. There you are. And underneath?" 
"'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'" "What have you to say now?"
Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it 
down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A

few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which 
was peculiar to him.
"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un' protruding out of his pocket, 
you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in 
front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from 
him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the 
end of our quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go 
on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for
to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves 
who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we 
had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle 
of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, 
framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were all at the devil together. 
If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. 
Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off 
you?"
"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little man. "Well, then, ask Mrs. 
Oakshott for it."
"She told me to ask you."
"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had enough of it. Get out of this!" He 
rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come with me, and we will 
see what is to be made of this fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who 
lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched 
him upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of 
colour had been driven from his face.
"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.
"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing the questions 
which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you."
"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know."
"But you can know nothing of this?"
"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold 
by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. 
Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried the little fellow with 
outstretched hands and quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in 
this matter."
Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it 
in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before 
we go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered with a sidelong 
glance. "No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business with 
an alias."
A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James 
Ryder."
"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall 
soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know."
The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful 
eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then 
he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. 
Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, 
and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. "The fire looks very seasonable 
in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my 
slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became 
of those geese?"
"Yes, sir."
"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested--
white, with a black bar across the tail."
Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?" "It came 
here."
"Here?"
"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in 
it. It laid an egg after it was dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I 
have it here in my museum."
Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes 
unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a 
cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain 
whether to claim or to disown it.
"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or you'll be into the fire! Give him 
an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
105
Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be 
sure!"
For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into 
his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.
"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is 
little which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case 
complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar's?"
"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a crackling voice.
"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired 
was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very 
scrupulous in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very 
pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some 
such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, 
then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you 
managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the
jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then--"
Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion's knees. "For 
God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked. "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their 
hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't 
bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"
"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe and crawl now, but you 
thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break 
down."
"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came 
the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for 
there lies your only hope of safety."
Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. 
"When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away 
with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into 
their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be 
safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's house. She had married a 
man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All 
the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that 
it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My 
sister asked me what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been 
upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and 
wondered what it would be best to do.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
106
"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in 
Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they 
could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two 
things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him 
into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money. But how to get to 
him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at 
any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I 
was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about 
round my feet, and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat 
the best detective that ever lived.
"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a 
Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose 
now, and in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind 
this I drove one of the birds--a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its 
bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a 
gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped 
and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to 
her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.
"'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
"'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I was feeling which was the 
fattest.'
"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's the big white one over 
yonder. There's twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen 
for the market.'
"'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you, I'd rather have that one I was 
handling just now.' "'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we fattened it 
expressly for you.'
"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it you want, then?' "'That white one 
with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.'
"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal 
what I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until 
he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was 
no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed 
back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
"'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried. "'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
"'Which dealer's?'
"'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
107
"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same as the one I chose?' "'Yes, Jem; 
there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.'
"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man 
Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where 
they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. 
My sister thinks that I am going mad.
Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without 
ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He 
burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of 
Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open 
the door.
"Get out!" said he.
"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!" "No more words. Get out!"
And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a 
door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street.
"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by 
the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but 
this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am 
commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong 
again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. 
Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and 
whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness to touch 
the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief 
feature."
ADVENTURE VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years 
studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large 
number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of 
his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any 
investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all these 
varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that 
which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The 
events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were 
sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them upon 
record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been 
freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It 
is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there 
are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the 
matter even more terrible than the truth.

It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, 
fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the 
mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some 
surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. 
Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."
"What is it, then--a fire?"
"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who 
insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander 
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, 
I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove 
to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at 
any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."
"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in 
admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis 
with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my 
clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A 
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we 
entered.
"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my 
intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before 
myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray 
draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as 
requested. "What, then?"
"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she 
was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened 
eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of 
thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. 
Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
all-comprehensive glances.
"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. "We shall 
soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
"You know me, then?"
"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must 
have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you 
reached the station."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
109
The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.
"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left arm of your jacket is 
spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no 
vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the 
left-hand side of the driver."
"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home 
before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I 
can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, 
save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, 
Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore 
need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, 
too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At 
present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall 
be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me 
ungrateful."
Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.
"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was 
before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care 
to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but 
you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. 
And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion 
upon the matter."
"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so 
vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to 
another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks 
upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can 
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can 
see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk 
amid the dangers which encompass me."
"I am all attention, madam."
"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of 
the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of 
Surrey."
Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the 
borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, 
four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was 
eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few 
acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy 
mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
110
aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the 
new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical 
degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he 
established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had 
been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a 
capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned 
to England a morose and disappointed man.
"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of MajorGeneral Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two 
years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not 
less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided 
with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the 
event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight 
years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to 
establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at 
Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there 
seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and 
exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke 
Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to 
indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper 
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case 
it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful 
brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of 
the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and 
absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by 
paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public 
exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these 
vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the 
family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with 
them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent 
over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which 
wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.
"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our 
lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She 
was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as 
mine has."
"Your sister is dead, then?"
"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can 
understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our 
own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria 
Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
111
lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of 
marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my 
sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day 
which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my 
only companion."
Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a 
cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
"Pray be precise as to details," said he.
"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The 
manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The 
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of
the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third 
my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same 
corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
"Perfectly so."
"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone 
to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by 
the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, 
therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching 
wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?' 
"'Never,' said I.
"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?' "'Certainly not. But 
why?'
"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, 
clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--
perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you 
whether you had heard it.'
"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'
"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.' "'Ah, but I 
sleep more heavily than you.'
"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a 
few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."
"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?" "Always."
"And why?"
"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no 
feeling of security unless our doors were locked."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
112
"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister 
and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two 
souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain 
was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, 
there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I 
sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my 
door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a 
clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was 
unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what 
was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the 
opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to 
and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment 
her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible 
pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised 
me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, 
my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she 
would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the 
doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling 
loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he 
reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat 
and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died 
without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you 
swear to it?"
"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I 
heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly 
have been deceived."
"Was your sister dressed?"
"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and 
in her left a match-box."
"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is 
important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"
"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in 
the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that 
the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were 
carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also 
thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large 
staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, 
there were no marks of any violence upon her."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

"How about poison?"
"The doctors examined her for it, but without success." "What do you think that this 
unfortunate lady died of, then?"
"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened 
her I cannot imagine."
"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?" "Yes, there are nearly always some there."
"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"
"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may 
have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not 
know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might 
have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied. "These are very deep waters," 
said he; "pray go on with your narrative."
"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month 
ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to 
ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. 
Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, 
and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started 
in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to 
move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. 
Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I 
suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her 
own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too 
shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, 
got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I 
have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."
"You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me all?" "Yes, all."
"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather." "Why, what do you mean?"
For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our 
visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon 
the white wrist.
"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard man," she said, "and 
perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."
There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into 
the crackling fire.
"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details which I should 
desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If 
we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms 
without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
114
"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is 
probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have 
a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?" "By no means."
"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by 
the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to 
attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?"
"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall 
look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face 
and glided from the room.
"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair. "It 
seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
"Dark enough and sinister enough."
"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, 
window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when 
she met her mysterious end."
"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the 
dying woman?" "I cannot think."
"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on 
intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the 
doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, 
and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been 
caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think 
that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
"But what, then, did the gipsies do?" "I cannot imagine."
"I see many objections to any such theory."
"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to 
see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of 
the devil!"
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been 
suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume 
was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long 
frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he 
that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it 
across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
115
sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his 
deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance 
to a fierce old bird of prey.
"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my companion quietly. "I am Dr. 
Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she 
been saying to you?"
"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man furiously.
"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.
"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his 
hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the 
meddler."
My friend smiled. "Holmes, the busybody!" His smile broadened.
"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out 
close the door, for there is a decided draught."
"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss 
Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped 
swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the 
fireplace he strode out of the room.
"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he 
had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." 
As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident 
gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer 
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order 
breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some 
data which may help us in this matter."
It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his 
hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
116
"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I have 
been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The 
total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, 
through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an 
income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had 
married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple 
him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that 
he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, 
Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are 
interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. 
I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is 
an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a toothbrush are, I think, all that we need."
At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at 
the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfec t 
day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges 
were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the 
moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the 
spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of 
the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, 
buried in the deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and 
pointed over the meadows.
"Look there!" said he.
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest 
point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old 
mansion.
"Stoke Moran?" said he.
"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.
"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."
"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; 
"but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the 
foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."
"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had 
better do as you suggest."
We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.
"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile, "that this fellow should think we had 
come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, 
Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
117
Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. "I 
have been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned 
out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before 
evening."
"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, and in a few 
words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then." "So it appears."
"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he 
returns?"
"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon 
his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to 
your aunt's at Harrow.
Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we 
are to examine."
The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving 
wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows 
were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of 
ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively 
modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, 
showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the 
end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at 
the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and 
examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.
"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, 
and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very 
pressing need for repairs at that end wall."
"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."
"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which 
these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"
"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."
"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, 
would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, 
endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit 
through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
118
but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his 
chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass 
these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the 
matter."
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. 
Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in 
which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a 
homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old countryhouses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in 
another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two 
small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton 
carpet in the centre. The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, wormeaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the 
house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled 
round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.
"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which 
hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
"It goes to the housekeeper's room." "It looks newer than the other things?"
"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago." "Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."
"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few 
minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his 
lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks 
between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was 
panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running 
his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
"Why, it's a dummy," said he. "Won't it ring?"
"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is 
fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."
"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are one or two very singular 
points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into 
another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside 
air!"
"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
119
"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators
which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches 
into the inner apartment."
Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly 
furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an 
armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron 
safe were the principal things which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined 
each and all of them with the keenest interest.
"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe. "My stepfather's business papers."
"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers." "There isn't a cat in it, for 
example?"
"No. What a strange idea!"
"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it. "No; we 
don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very 
far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He 
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest 
attention.
"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here 
is something interesting!"
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed. The 
lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
"What do you make of that, Watson?"
"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied."
"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns 
his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and 
with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from 
the scene of this investigation. We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither 
Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his 
reverie.
"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every 
respect." "I shall most certainly do so."
"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance." "I 
assure you that I am in your hands."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
120
"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room." Both Miss Stoner 
and I gazed at him in astonishment.
"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?" "Yes, that is 
the Crown."
"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?" "Certainly."
"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather 
comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your 
window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with 
everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no 
doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
"Oh, yes, easily."
"The rest you will leave in our hands." "But what will you do?"
"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which 
has disturbed you."
"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her 
hand upon my companion's sleeve.
"Perhaps I have."
"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death." "I should prefer to have 
clearer proofs before I speak."
"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden 
fright."
"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, 
Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in 
vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that 
we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown 
Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the 
avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. 
Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who 
drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the 
hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him. 
The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as 
the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, "I have 
really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
"Can I be of assistance?"
"Your presence might be invaluable." "Then I shall certainly come."
"It is very kind of you."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
121
"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me." 
"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."
"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is 
more than I can imagine."
"You saw the ventilator, too?"
"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two 
rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."
"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran." "My dear 
Holmes!"
"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's 
cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the 
two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's 
inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
"But what harm can there be in that?"
"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a 
lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
"I cannot as yet see any connection."
"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?" "No."
"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?" "I cannot say 
that I have."
"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the 
ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to 
prevent some subtle and horrible crime."
"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. 
He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their 
profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike 
deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us 
have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction 
of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of 
eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from the middle window."
As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going
on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. 
A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow 
light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
122
There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park 
wall. Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to 
enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed 
to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and 
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his 
agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.
"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps 
we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind 
when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the 
bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and 
cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me 
and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I 
could do to distinguish the words:
"The least sound would be fatal to our plans." I nodded to show that I had heard.
"We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator." I nodded again.
"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should 
need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he 
laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we 
were left in darkness.
How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a 
breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same 
state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we 
waited in absolute darkness.
From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long 
drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could 
hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long 
they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat 
waiting silently for whatever might befall.
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which 
vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. 
Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then 
all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining 
ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes 
sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.
"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but 
the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at 
which my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and 
filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator 
when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have 
ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all 
mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the 
distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and 
I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence 
from which it rose.
"What can it mean?" I gasped.
"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take 
your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."
With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the 
chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his 
heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter 
half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. 
Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressinggown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. 
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His 
chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the 
ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed 
to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself 
from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten 
seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls 
into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can 
then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has 
happened."
As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose 
round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw 
it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.

Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary 
that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we 
broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care 
of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion 
that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I 
had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.
"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how 
dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use 
of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which 
she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon 
an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position 
when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the 
room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as 
I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the 
bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly 
gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the 
hole and coming to the bed.
The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the 
doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the 
right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any 
chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an 
Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his 
point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could 
distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done 
their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the 
morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which 
we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour 
that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. 
It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but 
sooner or later she must fall a victim.
"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair 
showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary 
in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the
loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The 
metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the 
door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps 
which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt 
that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the 
blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first 
person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, 
and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

ADVENTURE IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution 
during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to 
his notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton's madness. Of these 
the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was 
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being 
placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of 
reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe, been told 
more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking 
when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before 
your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step 
which leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression 
upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.
It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am 
now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in 
his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him 
to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, 
and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients 
from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, 
was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer 
over whom he might have any influence.
One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door 
to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and 
hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed 
the door tightly behind him.
"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's all right."
"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which 
he had caged up in my room.
"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip 
away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same 
as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly 
dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. 
Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with 
bloodstains. He was young, not more than
five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and 
gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took 
all his strength of mind to control.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
126
"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I have had a very serious accident 
during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I 
might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I 
see that she has left it upon the side-table."
I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd 
floor)." That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have kept 
you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I 
understand, which is in itself a monotonous occupation."
"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, 
with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts 
rose up against that laugh.
"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out some water from a caraffe.
It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a 
strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once 
more, very weary and
pale-looking.
"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come 
back to his bloodless cheeks.
"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or 
rather to the place where my thumb used to be."
He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a 
shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface 
where the thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have bled considerably."
"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long 
time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief 
very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province."
"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very heavy and sharp instrument." "A 
thing like a cleaver," said he.
"An accident, I presume?" "By no means."
"What! a murderous attack?" "Very murderous indeed." "You horrify me."
I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and 
carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
127
"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have 
had a good deal to go through."
"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."
"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not 
for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my 
statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with 
which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague 
that it is a question whether justice will be done."
"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved, I 
should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to 
the official police."
"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should be very glad if he would 
take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me 
an introduction to him?"
"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself." "I should be immensely obliged to you."
"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do 
you feel equal to it?"
"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, 
explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with 
my new acquaintance to Baker Street.
Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, 
reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was 
composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried 
and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, 
ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he 
settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass 
of brandy and water within his reach.
"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, 
lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you 
are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
"Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and I 
think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time 
as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
128
Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen 
and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story 
which our visitor detailed to us.
"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in 
London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my 
work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known 
firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum 
of money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself and took 
professional chambers in Victoria Street.
"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To 
me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small 
job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to 
27 pounds 10s. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my 
little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have 
any practice at all.
"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there 
was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with 
the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel 
himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I 
have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the s kin 
of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to 
be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his bearing 
assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty 
than thirty.
"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent. 'You have been recommended 
to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also 
discreet and capable of preserving a secret.'
"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was 
who gave me so good a character?'
"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it from the 
same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this 
bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter 
that you wished to speak to me?'
"'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a professional 
commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, 
and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in 
the bosom of his family.'
"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
129
"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious 
and questioning an eye.
"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last. "'Yes, I promise.'
"'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all, 
either in word or writing?'
"'I have already given you my word.'
"'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he flung open 
the door. The passage outside was empty.
"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their 
master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began 
to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the 
strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from 
showing my impatience.
"'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is of value.' Heaven forgive me for 
that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.
"'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked. "'Most admirably.'
"'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I simply want your opinion about 
a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall 
soon set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?'
"'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
"'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.' "'Where to?'
"'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire, and within seven 
miles of Reading. There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.'
"'Very good.'
"'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.' "'There is a drive, then?'
"'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'
"'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance of a train 
back. I should be compelled to stop the night.'
"'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
"'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'
"'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any 
inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
130
opinion from the very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of 
the business, there is plenty of time to do so.'
"I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I 
shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to 
understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'
"'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should 
have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all 
laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'
"'Entirely.'
"'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, 
and that it is only found in one or two places in England?'
"'I have heard so.'
"'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles of Reading. I 
was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my fields. 
On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and that it 
formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them, 
however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that 
their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my 
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no 
capital by which I could do this. I took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they 
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way 
we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have 
now been doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic 
press. This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice 
upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known 
that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and 
then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and 
carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human 
being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
"'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you 
could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out 
like gravel from a pit.'
"'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress the earth into bricks, so as to 
remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully 
into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he 
spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'
"'I shall certainly be there.'
"'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long, questioning gaze, and then, 
pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from the room.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
131
"Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may 
both think, at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of 
course, I was glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price 
upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On the 
other hand, the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, 
and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the 
necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my 
errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and 
started off, having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for the 
last train to Eyford, and I reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the only 
passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy 
porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate, however, I found my 
acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side.
Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was 
standing open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away 
we went as fast as the horse could go."
"One horse?" interjected Holmes. "Yes, only one."
"Did you observe the colour?"
"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the carriage. It was a chestnut." "Tiredlooking or fresh?"
"Oh, fresh and glossy."
"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting 
statement."
"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it 
was only seven miles, but I should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the 
time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the 
time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at 
me with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world, 
for we lurched and jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where 
we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out nothing save the 
occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the 
monotony of the journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the 
conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for the 
crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark 
sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of 
us. We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch 
the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that I had crossed the threshold 
the door slammed heavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage 
drove away.
"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and 
muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
132
long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with 
a lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us. 
I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark 
dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as 
though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave 
such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered 
something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he 
walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing 
open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the 
centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on 
the top of a harmonium beside the door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and 
vanished into the darkness.
"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that 
two of them were treatises on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked 
across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak 
shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old 
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A 
vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what 
were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And where was the place? I was 
ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had 
no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so 
the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute 
stillness, that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under 
my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness, the door of my 
room swung slowly open. The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall 
behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I could 
see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held 
up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken 
English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind 
her.
"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not 
stay here. There is no good for you to do.'
"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I have 
seen the machine.'
"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through the door; no one 
hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her 
constraint and made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love of Heaven!' 
she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'
"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage in an affair when 
there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
133
and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why 
should I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the payment which 
was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout bearing, 
therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my 
head and declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her 
entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon 
the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands with a despairing gesture, and 
vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come.
"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard 
growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under the impression 
that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close.'
"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' 
said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine.'
"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.' "'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All we wish you to do is to 
examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it.'
"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat manager and I behind him. 
It was a labyrinth of an old house, with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little 
low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed 
them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the 
plaster was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy 
blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the 
warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon my two 
companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man, but I could see from the little 
that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.
"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he unlocked. Within was a 
small, square room, in which the three of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained 
outside, and the colonel ushered me in.
"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly 
unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really 
the end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this 
metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force, and 
which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you.
The machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost 
a little of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we 
can set it right.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
134
"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a 
gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, 
and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that 
there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side 
cylinders. An examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the 
head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This 
was clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who followed 
my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed 
to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the 
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that 
the story of the fuller's-earth was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that 
so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of wood, 
but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a crust 
of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was 
when I heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel 
looking down at me.
"'What are you doing there?' he asked.
"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me. 'I was 
admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your 
machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.'
"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech. His face set hard, 
and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.
"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He took a step backward, slammed 
the little door, and turned the key in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but 
it was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! 
Colonel! Let me out!'
"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth. It was 
the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The 
lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its light I 
saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better 
than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw 
myself, screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the 
colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries. The ceiling 
was only a foot or two above my head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough 
surface. Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much 
upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, 
and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the 
nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was 
unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to 
my heart.
"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls were of wood. As I gave a 
last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which 
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
135
believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself 
through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but 
the crash of the lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told 
me how narrow had been my escape.
"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the 
stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left 
hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so 
foolishly rejected.
"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you 
are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!'
"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the 
corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we 
reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering 
the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and 
looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door which led into a 
bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.
"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'
"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean 
figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a 
butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked 
out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not 
be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I 
should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she 
were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had 
hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she 
threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after the last time. You said it should 
not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be the ruin of us. 
He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the 
window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to 
the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the 
garden below.
"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as 
hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, 
however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, 
which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off 
and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round 
it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among 
the rose-bushes.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
136
"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the 
moon had sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all 
sodden with dew, and my
coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in 
an instant all the particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling 
that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look 
round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge 
close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my 
approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were it 
not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might 
have been an evil dream.
"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to 
Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I 
arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was 
strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. 
Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.
"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town 
before telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have 
my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case 
into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise."
We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then 
Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in 
which he placed his cuttings.
"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It appeared in all the papers about 
a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a 
hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. 
Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his 
machine overhauled, I fancy."
"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the girl said."
"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was 
absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those outand-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is 
precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to 
starting for Eyford."
Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to 
the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector 
Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a
plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon 
the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.
"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village. The 
place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
137
"It was an hour's good drive."
"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?"
"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been lifted and conveyed 
somewhere."
"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have spared you when they found you 
lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."
"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have drawn my circle, and I only 
wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see 
who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the country is more deserted there."
"And I say east," said my patient.
"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are several quiet little villages up 
there."
"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, and our friend says that he did 
not notice the carriage go up any."
"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity of opinion. We have boxed 
the compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"
"You are all wrong." "But we can't all be."
"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the centre of the circle. "This is 
where we shall find them."
"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy 
when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "Of course there can be 
no doubt as to the nature of this gang."
"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and have used the machine to 
form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver."
"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said the inspector. "They have 
been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
138
could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very 
old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of 
justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up 
from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich 
feather over the landscape.
"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way.
"Yes, sir!" said the station-master. "When did it break out?"
"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and the whole place is in a blaze." 
"Whose house is it?"
"Dr. Becher's."
"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, and there isn't a man 
in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a 
patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would 
do him no harm."
The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of 
the fire. The road topped a low hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in 
front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the gravel-drive, and there are the 
rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is the one that I jumped from."
"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. There can be no question 
that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, 
though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time. Now 
keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night, though I very much fear that 
they are a good hundred miles off by now."
And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard 
either of the beautiful woman, the sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that 
morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving 
rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even 
Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found 
within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of 
the second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and they 
subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been reduced to 
such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of 
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
139
and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may 
have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to.
How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he 
recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, 
which told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of 
whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most 
probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had 
assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger.
"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has 
been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what 
have I gained?"
"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only to 
put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your 
existence."
ADVENTURE X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of 
interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals 
have eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this fouryear-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the full facts have never been 
revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in 
clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little 
sketch of this remarkable episode.
It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms 
with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the 
table waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn 
to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my 
limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one 
easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until 
at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the 
huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my 
friend's noble correspondent could be.
"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I 
remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he answered, smiling, "and the 
humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social 
summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
140
"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all." "Not social, then?"
"No, distinctly professional." "And from a noble client?" "One of the highest in England."
"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less 
moment to me than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not 
be wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have 
you not?"
"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. "I have had nothing else 
to do."
"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal 
news and the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent 
events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?"
"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and 
in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. 
This is what he says:
"'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance 
upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to 
consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my 
wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that 
he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it might be of some 
assistance. I will call at four o'clock in the afternoon, and, should you have any other 
engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount 
importance.
Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'
"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the 
misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes 
as he folded up the epistle.
"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."
"Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those 
papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client 
is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. 
"Here he is," said he, sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert 
Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three 
caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years of age, which is mature 
for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his 
father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct 
descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in all this. I 
think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
141
"I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for the facts are quite recent, and the 
matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had 
an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters."
"Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared 
up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your 
newspaper selections."
"Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the Morning Post, and 
dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if rumour 
is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of 
Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, 
Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
"Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.
"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here 
it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade 
principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the 
noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the 
Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes 
which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown 
himself for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has now definitely 
announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a 
California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much 
attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child, and it is currently reported that her 
dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As it is an 
open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last 
few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, 
it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable 
her to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.'"
"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would 
be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a 
dozen intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished 
house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, 
on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that
the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the 
notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start. "The vanishing of the lady."
"When did she vanish, then?" "At the wedding breakfast."
"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact." "Yes; it struck 
me as being a little out of the common."
"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot 
call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
142
"I warn you that they are very incomplete." "Perhaps we may make them less so."
"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I 
will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the 
strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The 
ceremony, as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; 
but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so 
persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so 
much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by 
affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, 
no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, 
Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the 
bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house 
of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that 
some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who 
endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some 
claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected 
by the butler and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this 
unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a 
sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some 
comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her 
chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One 
of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had 
refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining 
that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, 
instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic inquiries are 
being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up 
to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing 
lady. There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the 
arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy 
or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the 
bride.'"
"And is that all?"
"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one." "And it is--"
"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It 
appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the 
bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your 
hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the public press."
"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But 
there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no 
doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very 
much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open the door. A gentleman 
entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of 
petulance about the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot
it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his general 
appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little 
bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very
curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was 
careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow 
gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, 
turning his head from left to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden 
eyeglasses.
"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray take the basket-chair. This is 
my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter 
over."
"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to 
the quick. I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, 
though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of society."
"No, I am descending." "I beg pardon."
"My last client of the sort was a king."
"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
"The King of Scandinavia." "What! Had he lost his wife?"
"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the 
same secrecy which I promise to you in yours."
"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give 
you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion."
"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints, nothing more. I presume that I 
may take it as correct-- this article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."
"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I 
may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."
"Pray do so."
"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?" "In San Francisco, a year ago."
"You were travelling in the States?" "Yes."
"Did you become engaged then?" "No."
"But you were on a friendly footing?"
"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused." "Her father is very rich?"
"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope." "And how did he make his money?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
144
"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, and came up by 
leaps and bounds."
"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your wife's character?"
The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire. "You see, Mr. 
Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time 
she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her 
education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in 
England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of traditions. She 
is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in 
carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name which I 
have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom 
a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything 
dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
"Have you her photograph?"
"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely 
woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full 
effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed 
long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your acquaintance?"
"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became 
engaged to her, and have now married her."
"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?" "A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my 
family."
"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait accompli?" "I really have made 
no inquiries on the subject."
"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding?" "Yes."
"Was she in good spirits?"
"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives." "Indeed! That is very 
interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?" "She was as bright as possible--at least until 
after the ceremony."
"And did you observe any change in her then?"
"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a 
little sharp. The incident however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing 
upon the case."
"Pray let us have it, for all that."
"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry. She was passing 
the front pew at the time, and it fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the 
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
145
fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on 
our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the general public were 
present, then?" "Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open."
"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I 
hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the 
point."
"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had 
gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"
"I saw her in conversation with her maid." "And who is her maid?"
"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with her." "A confidential 
servant?"
"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, 
of course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."
"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of." "You did not overhear what they said?"
"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang of 
the kind. I have no idea what she meant."
"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do when she finished 
speaking to her maid?"
"She walked into the breakfast-room." "On your arm?"
"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down 
for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. 
She never came back."
"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's 
dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet, and went out."
"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar, a 
woman who is now in custody, and who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house 
that morning."
"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and your relations to her."
Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. "We have been on a friendly 
footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I 
have not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but you 
know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed 
and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
146
to be married, and, to tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly 
was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just 
after we returned, and she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions 
towards my wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of 
the sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. 
She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."
"Did your wife hear all this?" "No, thank goodness, she did not."
"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that 
Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her."
"Well, it is a possible supposition." "You think so, too?"
"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?" "I do not think 
Flora would hurt a fly."
"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what 
took place?"
"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have given you all the facts. Since 
you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of 
this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the effect of 
causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."
"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so 
much that many have aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. 
Simon, I think that I have nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the 
breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate with you." 
"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.
"I have solved it." "Eh? What was that?"
"I say that I have solved it." "Where, then, is my wife?"
"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he 
remarked, and bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own," said 
Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this 
cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the 
room."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
147
"My dear Holmes!"
"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, which were quite as 
prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial 
evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote 
Thoreau's example."
"But I have heard all that you have heard."
"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well. There was a 
parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at 
Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases--but, hullo, here is 
Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and 
there are cigars in the box."
The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly 
nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he 
seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."
"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor 
tail of the business."
"Really! You surprise me."
"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have 
been at work upon it all day."
"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the 
pea-jacket. "Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
"In heaven's name, what for?"
"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked. "Why? What do you 
mean?"
"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other."
Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you know all about it," he snarled. 
"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?" "I think it very 
unlikely."
"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as 
he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin 
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. "There," said he, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
148
putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, 
Master Holmes."
"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. "You dragged them from the 
Serpentine?"
"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as 
her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his 
wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"
"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance." "I am afraid that you will find 
it difficult."
"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are 
not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as 
many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
"And how?"
"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the 
very note." He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me 
when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon 
was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible 
for her disappearance. Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt 
quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach."
"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." 
He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a 
little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.
"Ha! you find it so?"
"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at 
the wrong side!"
"On the contrary, this is the right side."
"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here."
"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply."
"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. "'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 
6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least 
the initials are, so I congratulate you again."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
149
"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the 
fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of 
the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the 
door.
"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you the 
true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, 
any such person."
Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three 
times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is 
something in what the fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that 
I must leave you to your papers for a little."
It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within 
an hour there arrived a confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the 
help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, 
a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house 
mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pâté de foie gras pie 
with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my two visitors 
vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the things 
had been paid for and were ordered to this address.
Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were 
gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been 
disappointed in his conclusions.
"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands. "You seem to expect company. 
They have laid for five."
"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. 
Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more 
vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for 
what you say?" "The best possible."
Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of the family has been 
subjected to such humiliation?"
"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation." "Ah, you look on these 
things from another standpoint."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
150
"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, 
though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she 
had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the table. "You 
must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."
"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used."
"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot 
persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate 
here who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. 
"Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The 
lady, I think, you have already met."
At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with 
his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended 
dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still 
refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was 
one which it was hard to resist.
"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every cause to be." "Pray make no 
apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I 
went; but I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't 
know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down and do a faint right there 
before the altar."
"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain 
this matter?"
"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much 
secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the 
rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert 
manner.
"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's 
camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank 
and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a 
claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last 
pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank 
wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa 
knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up 
for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim 
me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and 
pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right 
away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until 
I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all 
ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and 
I went back to pa.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
151
"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in 
Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story 
about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's 
name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I 
had a decline and took me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year 
and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 
'Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I 
felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been 
given to my poor Frank.
"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done my duty by him. We can't 
command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to 
make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just 
as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the 
first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a 
kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I 
didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the clergyman were 
just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and 
make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was 
thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a 
piece of paper, and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I
dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me 
the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so. Of 
course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to 
do just whatever he might direct.
"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and had always been his 
friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know 
I ought to have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all 
those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been 
at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. He 
beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and 
followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage 
also--but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, 
and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true 
wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had 
escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, 
followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding."
"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name and the church but not where 
the lady lived."
"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for openness, but I was so 
ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--
just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all 
those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So 
Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be

traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we 
should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came 
round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us 
very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting 
ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to 
Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you 
have heard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think 
very meanly of me."
Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened with a frowning 
brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative.
"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in 
this public manner."
"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand and coldly grasped that 
which she extended to him.
"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us in a friendly supper."
"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to 
acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over 
them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good-night." He included 
us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is 
always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the folly 
of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children 
from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a 
quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, 
"because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at 
first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of 
events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, 
by Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the lady had been quite willing 
to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes 
of returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her 
to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have spoken to anyone 
when she was out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, 
then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in 
this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over 
her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

have already arrived, by a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an 
American. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much influence 
over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been 
spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. 
Simon's narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of 
so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her 
confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' 
parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to--the whole 
situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover 
or was a previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
"And how in the world did you find them?"
"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of 
which he did not himself know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance, but
more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most 
select London hotels."
"How did you deduce the select?"
"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to 
one of the most expensive hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate. In 
the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the 
book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on 
looking over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I had seen in the 
duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and 
being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some 
paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should 
make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular. 
I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."
"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."
"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after all 
the trouble of wooing and wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of 
fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we 
are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my 
violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal 
evenings."
ADVENTURE XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street, "here is a 
madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out 
alone."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing -
gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the 
day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down the 
centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at 
either side and on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The 
grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there 
were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no 
one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a massive, strongly marked face 
and a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining 
hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd 
contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little 
springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he 
ran he jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most 
extraordinary contortions.
"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is looking up at the numbers of the 
houses." "I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.
"Here?"
"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise the 
symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our 
door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but with so fixed a look 
of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For 
a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one 
who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, 
he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him 
away to the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, 
sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy, soothing tones which he 
knew so well how to employ.
"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he. "You are fatigued with your 
haste. Pray wait until you have recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into 
any little problem which you may submit to me."
The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he 
passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden and so terrible 
is it. Public disgrace I might have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet 
borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together, and in 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
155
so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very 
noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair."
"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a clear account of who you are and 
what it is that has befallen you."
"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, of 
the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest 
private banking concern in the City of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one 
of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until with 
another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when the police inspector 
suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground 
and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so 
out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the 
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
"It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon 
our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our 
connection and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out 
money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We have done a good 
deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble families to whom we 
have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by 
one of the clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, 
perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household 
word all over the earth--one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was 
overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at 
once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable 
task.
"'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money.'
"'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
"'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of 
course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a 
matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily 
understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'
"'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
"'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you 
advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that 
the money should be paid at once.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
156
"'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 
'were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am 
to do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your 
case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'
"'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he 
had laid beside his chair. 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
"'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,' said I.
"'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay the 
magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' 
said he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the 
worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you 
as my security.'
"I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious 
client. "'You doubt its value?' he asked.
"'Not at all. I only doubt--'
"'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream 
of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a 
pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
"'Ample.'
"'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I 
have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet 
and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with 
every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if 
any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for 
there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them. I 
leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person on Monday 
morning.'
"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered 
him to pay over fifty 1000 pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the 
precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of 
the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a 
national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I 
already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter 
the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.
"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the 
office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If 
so, how terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, 
that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me, so that 
it might never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
157
house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it 
upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the 
situation. My groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I 
have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute 
reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been 
in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has always 
given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally 
hung about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe 
her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. 
I am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. 
Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me 
that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to 
love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face. I have never 
denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I 
meant it for the best.
"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a 
business turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the 
handling of large sums of money.
When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming 
manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. 
He learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and 
again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might 
settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous 
company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, 
was enough to draw him back again.
"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an 
influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself 
that I could hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the 
world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a 
man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour 
of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his 
eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little 
Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.
"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five 
years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as 
my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and 
housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I 
do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my 
wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she 
has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have 
been she, and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--
forever too late!
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
158
"Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my 
miserable story.
"When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and 
Mary my experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing 
only the name of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the 
room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur were much interested and 
wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
"'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur. "'In my own bureau.'
"'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the night.' said he. "'It is locked 
up,' I answered.
"'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the 
key of the box-room cupboard.'
"He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to 
my room, however, that night with a very grave face.
"'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let me have 200 pounds?'
"'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too generous with you in money matters.'
"'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money, or else I can never show my 
face inside the club again.'
"'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
"'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,' said he. 'I could not bear the 
disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try 
other means.'
"I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. 'You shall not have a 
farthing from me,' I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.
"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it 
again. Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I usually 
leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the 
stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as I 
approached.
"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave 
to go out to-night?'
"'Certainly not.'
"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side 
gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
159
"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is 
fastened?'
"'Quite sure, dad.'
"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.
"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the 
case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear."
"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very 
heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than 
usual. About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had 
ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had 
gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears.
Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. 
I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room 
door.
"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'
"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, 
was standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at 
it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale 
as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in 
it, was missing.
"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have destroyed it! You have 
dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?'
"'Stolen!' he cried.
"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? 
Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'
"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say 
another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in 
the morning and make my own way in the world.'
"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have 
this matter probed to the bottom.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
160
"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was 
in his nature. 'If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.'
"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the 
first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the 
whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for 
the police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a 
constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his arms folded, asked me 
whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a 
private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I 
was determined that the law should have its way in everything.
"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as 
well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.'
"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And 
then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not 
only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened 
to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me 
what he had done with the three missing stones.
"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught in the act, and no confession 
could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by 
telling us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me with a 
sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but 
one way for it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once 
not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could 
possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the 
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was 
removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to 
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed 
that they can at present make nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think 
necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My God, what shall I do! I have lost 
my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a 
child whose grief has got beyond words.
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed 
upon the fire. "Do you receive much company?" he asked.
"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell 
has been several times lately. No one else, I think."
"Do you go out much in society?"
"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it." "That is unusual in a young 
girl."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
161
"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty." "This 
matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also." "Terrible! She is even 
more affected than I."
"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands."
"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?" 
"Yes, it was twisted."
"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?"
"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What 
was he doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut 
both ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the 
noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."
"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What 
did they say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?"
"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them." 
"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely 
examined."
"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes 
very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to 
you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your 
theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your 
dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small 
portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with 
such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room 
in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a 
theory tenable?"
"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of despair. "If his motives were 
innocent, why does he not explain them?"
"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set 
off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."
My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough 
to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. 
I confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his 
unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
162
some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly 
spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast 
and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have 
taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even 
broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a 
shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence of the great financier.
Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A 
double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates 
which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a 
narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and 
forming the tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the stables, and was not 
itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us 
standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the 
tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that 
Mr.
Holder and I went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were 
sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in. She was rather above 
the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against the absolute 
pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. 
Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently into 
the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the 
morning, and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, 
with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her 
uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?" she asked. "No, no, 
my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's instincts are. I know that he has 
done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."
"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."
"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?"
"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is 
innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in 
prison!"
"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds 
you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a 
gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now."

"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I 
suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my 
cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going 
back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing 
Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up." "You heard nothing yourself last 
night?"
"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down." "You shut 
up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?" "Yes."
"Were they all fastened this morning?"
"Yes."
"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that 
she had been out to see him?"
"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle's 
remarks about the coronet."
"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have 
planned the robbery."
"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the banker impatiently, "when I have 
told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?"
"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her 
return by the kitchen door, I presume?"
"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the 
man, too, in the gloom."
"Do you know him?"
"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."
"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to say, farther up the path than is 
necessary to reach the door?"
"Yes, he did."
"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a 
magician," said she. "How do you know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in 
Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over the outside 
of the house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the large one which looked 
from the hall onto the stable lane. This he opened and made a very careful examination of the 
sill with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.
The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with a grey carpet, a large 
bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the lumber-room." "Have you it 
here?"
"That is it on the dressing-table."
Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, 
contains the coronet. We must have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the 
diadem he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller's art, and the 
thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked 
edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been 
so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."
The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying," said he.
"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a 
little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my 
time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did 
break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this 
happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?"
"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?" "I confess that I 
still share my uncle's perplexity."
"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?" "He had nothing on save only his 
trousers and shirt."
"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry, and it
will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your 
permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."
He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might 
make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet 
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
165
"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best 
by returning to my rooms."
"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?" "I cannot tell."
The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "And my son? You give 
me hopes?" "My opinion is in no way altered."
"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?"
"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten I 
shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche 
to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I 
may draw."
"I would give my fortune to have them back."
"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then. Good-bye; it is just possible that 
I may have to come over here again before evening."
It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about the case, although 
what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our 
homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to 
some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found 
ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few 
minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red 
cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass above the fireplace. "I only wish 
that you could come with me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in this 
matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I hope that I 
may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard, 
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he 
started off upon his expedition.
I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old 
elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of 
tea.
"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on." "Where to?"
"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for 
me in case I should be late."
"How are you getting on?"
"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did 
not call at the house. It is a very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good 
deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off and 
return to my highly respectable self."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
166
I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone 
would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. 
He hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me 
that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no 
uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, 
so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I 
came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the 
paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.
"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our 
client has rather an early appointment this morning."
"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I 
heard a ring."
It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, 
for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, 
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy 
which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily 
into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a 
happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and 
dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has 
deserted me."
"Deserted you?"
"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay 
upon the hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had 
married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. 
It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had acted 
differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my 
mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not 
worry about my future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will 
be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"
"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that 
you are nearing the end of your troubles."
"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where 
are the gems?"
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
167
"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for them?" "I would pay ten."
"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, 
I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, 
took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems 
to his bosom. "There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather 
sternly.
"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has 
carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance 
to have one."
"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known."
"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that 
he would not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and 
to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, 
however, may open his lips."
"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"
"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, 
that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding 
between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together."
"My Mary? Impossible!"
"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true 
character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most 
dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without 
heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, 
as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his 
heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit 
of seeing him nearly every evening."
"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an ashen face.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
168
"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she 
thought, gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which 
leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he 
stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he 
bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love 
of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had hardly 
listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the 
window rapidly and told you about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged 
lover, which was all perfectly true.
"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his 
uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, 
so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the 
passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad 
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange 
affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your 
son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, 
thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could 
see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the 
coronet to someone in the gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, 
passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of 
the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a 
misfortune this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, 
just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down 
the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get 
away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one 
side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George 
and cut him over the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had 
the coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just 
observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten 
it when you appeared upon the scene."
"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had 
deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying 
one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more 
chivalrous view, however, and preserved her secret."
"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, 
my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! 
The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How 
cruelly I have misjudged him!"
"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to 
observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen 
since the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I

passed along the tradesmen's path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just 
beyond it, however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a 
man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell 
that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was shown by 
the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone 
away. I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had 
already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing 
anything more than random tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable 
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me.
"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with 
delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me 
that the latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and 
as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had 
passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the hall window, where Boots 
had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a 
hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow 
was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had 
fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another 
little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the 
highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to 
that clue.
"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the 
hall window with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could 
distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then 
beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man had waited outside the 
window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had 
pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united 
strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the 
prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now 
was, who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?
"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, 
however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it 
down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should 
your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he 
loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--
the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at 
that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a 
certainty.
"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh 
the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that 
your circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had 
heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It must have been he 
who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had 
discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word 
without compromising his own family.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
170
"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a 
loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that 
his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made 
all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and 
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.
"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a 
delicate part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert 
scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I 
went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every 
particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I 
knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he 
became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he 
held--1000 pounds apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why, 
dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the three!' I soon managed to get the 
address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. 
Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000 pounds apiece. Then I 
looked in upon your son, told him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two 
o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."
"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said the banker, rising. "Sir, I 
cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. 
Your skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to 
apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it 
goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. 
It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than 
sufficient punishment."
ADVENTURE XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the 
advertisement sheet of the Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest 
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, 
Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which 
you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you 
have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which 
I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but 
which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have 
made my special province."
"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of 
sensationalism which has been urged against my records."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
171
"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting 
with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a 
disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred perhaps in attempting to put 
colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing 
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature 
about the thing."
"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter," I remarked with some coldness, 
for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in 
my friend's singular character.
"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather 
than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing --a thing 
beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon 
the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of 
lectures into a series of tales."
It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery 
fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured 
houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow 
wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the 
table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping 
continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having 
apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon 
my literary shortcomings.
"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe 
and gazing down into the fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of 
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat 
of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of 
Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the 
man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are 
outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may have bordered 
on the trivial."
"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold to have been novel and of 
interest."
"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell 
a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis 
and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases 
are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own 
little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and 
giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched bottom at last, 
however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a 
crumpled letter across to me.
It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
172
"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not 
accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten tomorrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully, "VIOLET HUNTER."
"Do you know the young lady?" I asked. "Not I."
"It is half-past ten now."
"Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
"It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue 
carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It 
may be so in this case, also."
"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much 
mistaken, is the person in question."
As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly 
dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a 
woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, 
"but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from 
whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I 
should do."
"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."
I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. 
He looked her over in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping 
and his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
"I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the family of Colonel Spence Munro, but 
two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his 
children over to America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I 
answered advertisements, but without success. At last the little money which I had saved began 
to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
"There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway's, and there I 
used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might 
suit me. Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by 
Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in 
an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers and sees 
whether she has anything which would suit them.
"Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss 
Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin 
which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his 
chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
"'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite 
enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a 
comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
"'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked. "'Yes, sir.'
"'As governess?' "'Yes, sir.'
"'And what salary do you ask?'
"'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.'
"'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into the air like a 
man who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such 
attractions and accomplishments?'
"'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little 
German, music, and drawing--'
"'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have you or have you not 
the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not 
fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the 
country. But if you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept 
anything under the three figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 
pounds a year.'
"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too 
good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, 
opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
"'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two 
little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their 
salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their 
wardrobe.'
"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already 
in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something 
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite 
committed myself.
"'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
"'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of 
Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old countryhouse.'
"'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.'
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
174
"'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing 
cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He 
leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
"I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement, but the father's laughter made 
me think that perhaps he was joking.
"'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single child?'
"'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am 
sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided 
always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no 
difficulty, heh?'
"'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
"'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know--faddy but kind-hearted. 
If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little 
whim. Heh?'
"'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
"'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?' "'Oh, no.'
"'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat 
luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not 
dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
"'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out of his 
small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
"'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, 
you know, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your hair?'
"'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
"'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you 
would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of 
your young ladies.'
"The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but 
she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting 
that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
"'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked. "'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
"'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion,' 
said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
175
you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by 
the page.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and 
two or three bills upon the table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish 
thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most 
extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few 
governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? 
Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. 
Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. 
I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the 
place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I 
will read it to you:
"'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester. "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly 
given me your address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your 
decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my 
description of you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to 
recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very 
exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to 
wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of 
purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), 
which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing 
yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, 
it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short 
interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the 
increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, 
are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester.
Let me know your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
"That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will 
accept it. I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole 
matter to your consideration."
"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question," said Holmes, smiling. 
"But you would not advise me to refuse?"
"I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for." "What 
is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
"Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?"
"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very 
kind,
good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter 
quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way 
in order to prevent an outbreak?"
"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any 
case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
176
"But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
"Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should 
they give you 120 pounds a year, when they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must 
be some strong reason behind."
"I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted 
your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
"Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to 
be the most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly 
novel about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"
"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. 
"But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."
"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face. "I 
shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, 
sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow." With a few grateful words 
to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way.
"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, "she seems to be a 
young lady who is very well able to take care of herself."
"And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from 
her before many days are past."
It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during 
which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange 
side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the 
curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or 
a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to 
determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted 
brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I 
mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And 
yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such 
a situation.
The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning 
in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he 
frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night 
and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning. He opened 
the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back to his chemical studies. The 
summons was a brief and urgent one.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
177
"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I 
am at my wit's end. HUNTER."
"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up. "I should wish to."
"Just look it up, then."
"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 
11:30."
"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as 
we may need to be at our best in the morning."
By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes 
had been buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the 
Hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring 
day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. The 
sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge 
to a man's energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little 
red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new 
foliage.
"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs 
of Baker Street.
But Holmes shook his head gravely.
"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine 
that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these 
scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought 
which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be 
committed there."
"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?"
"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, 
that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than 
does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
"You horrify me!"
"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law
cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a 
drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then 
the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and 
there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its 
own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of 
the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such 
places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
178
I should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. 
Still, it is clear that she is not personally threatened."
"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away." "Quite so. She has her 
freedom."
"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we 
know them. But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information 
which we shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we 
shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell."
The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there 
we found the young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited 
us upon the table.
"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It is so very kind of you both; but 
indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got 
his leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
"Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire 
and composed himself to listen.
"In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. 
and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am 
not easy in my mind about them."
"What can you not understand?"
"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, 
Mr. Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, 
beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, 
whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds 
round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the 
Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This 
ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton's 
preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name 
to the place.
"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him 
that evening to his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which 
seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found 
her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I 
should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five.
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
179
From their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that 
he was a widower, and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to 
Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that 
she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could not have been less 
than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her 
father's young wife.
"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me 
neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was 
passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered 
continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was 
kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy 
couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep 
thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I 
have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, 
for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, 
with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an 
alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any 
creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite 
remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would rather 
not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story."
"I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they seem to you to be relevant or 
not."
"I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, 
which struck me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, 
a man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and 
whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been quite 
drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong 
woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most 
unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, 
which are next to each other in one corner of the building.
"For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. 
Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
"'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to you, Miss Hunter, for falling in 
with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota 
from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will 
find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we 
should both be extremely obliged.'
"The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent 
material, a sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could 
not have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a 
delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting 
for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the 
house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
180
the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. 
Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the 
funniest stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I 
laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of 
humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look 
upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to 
commence the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in 
the nursery.
"Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. 
Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the 
funny stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire, and which he told inimitably. 
Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own 
shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for about ten 
minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he 
ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this 
extraordinary performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn 
my face away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was 
going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon devised a means. My 
hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of the 
glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my 
handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was 
behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first 
impression. At the second glance, however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the 
Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in my 
direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man, 
however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly 
up. I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with 
a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a 
mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss 
Hunter.' "'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
"'No, I know no one in these parts.'
"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.' "'Surely it 
would be better to take no notice.'
"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like 
that.'
"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a 
week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue 
dress, nor seen the man in the road."
"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
181
"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between 
the different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, 
Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we 
approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving 
about.
"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in 
the darkness.
"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, 
my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do 
anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as 
keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays 
his fangs upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your foot over the 
threshold at night, for it's as much as your life is worth.'
"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom 
window about two o'clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in 
front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the 
peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow 
of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, 
as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It 
walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful 
sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in 
London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the 
child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by 
rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper 
ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had 
still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It 
struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys 
and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There 
was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of 
hair.
"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then 
the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in 
the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from 
the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were 
identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it 
meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the 
Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had 
locked.
"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty 
good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
182
to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened 
into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. 
Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made 
him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks 
were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with 
passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.
"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I 
strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There 
were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered 
up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, 
Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. 
I was preoccupied with business matters.'
"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I, 'you seem to have quite a suite of 
spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.'
"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.
"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my dark room up there. But, dear 
me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who 
would have ever believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he 
looked at me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that 
suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere 
curiosity, though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a feeling that some 
good might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it 
was woman's instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on 
the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.
"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both 
Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a 
large black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and 
yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I 
have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and 
the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the 
lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right 
angle at the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of 
which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in 
the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through 
them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the 
broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other 
with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded 
door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
183
glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight 
which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and 
wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and 
saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out 
from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My 
overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran as though some dreadful hand 
were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the 
door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting outside.
"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw the door open.' 
"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how caressing and soothing his 
manner was--'and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?'
"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.
"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered. 'But it is so lonely and eerie in 
this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!'
"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
"'Why, what did you think?' I asked. "'Why do you think that I lock this door?' "'I am sure that I 
do not know.'
"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?' He was still smiling in the 
most amiable manner.
"'I am sure if I had known--'
"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again'--here in an 
instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a 
demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into 
my room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I 
thought of you, Mr.
Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the 
man, of the woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could 
only bring you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my 
curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would send you a 
wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half a mile from the 
house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I 
approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk 
himself into a state of insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the 
household who had any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him 
free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you. I 
had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I must be back 
before three o'clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the 
evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
184
and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should 
do."
Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced 
up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound 
gravity upon his face.
"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him." "That is well. And 
the Rucastles go out to-night?"
"Yes."
"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?" "Yes, the wine-cellar."
"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss 
Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did 
not think you a quite exceptional woman."
"I will try. What is it?"
"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be 
gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who 
might give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the 
key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely."
"I will do it."
"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible 
explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is 
imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is 
the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to America. 
You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height, figure, and the colour of your hair. 
Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of 
course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The 
man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers--possibly her fiancé--and no doubt, as 
you wore the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever 
he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and 
that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from 
endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the 
case is the disposition of the child."
"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a 
child by the study of the parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have 
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. 
This child's disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he derives 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
185
this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor 
girl who is in their power."
"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A thousand things come back to 
me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to 
this poor creature."
"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until 
seven o'clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the 
mystery."
We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, 
having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves 
shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house 
even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.
"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said 
she. "Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of 
Mr. Rucastle's."
"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now lead the way, and we shall 
soon see the end of this black business."
We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in 
front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the 
transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came 
from within, and at the silence Holmes' face clouded over.
"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in 
without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make 
our way in."
It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into 
the room. It was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a 
basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter's 
intentions and has carried his victim off."
"But how?"
"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He swung himself up onto the 
roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he 
did it."
"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went 
away."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
186
"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I s hould not be 
very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that 
it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very 
fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the 
wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.
"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught you, 
have I? You are in my power. I'll serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as 
he could go.
"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter. "I have my revolver," said I.
"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We 
had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, 
with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face 
and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been fed for two days. Quick, quick, 
or it'll be too late!"
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. 
There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he 
writhed and screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with 
its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With much labour we 
separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house.
We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the 
news to his wife, I did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when 
the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is 
a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains 
were wasted."
"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this 
matter than anyone else."
"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess 
that I am still in the dark."
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru
187
"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done so before now if I could ha' got 
out from the cellar. If there's police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the 
one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend too.
"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time that her father married again. 
She was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until 
after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of 
her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about 
them but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when 
there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give 
him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that 
whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on 
worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then she got 
better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no 
change in her young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter 
fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this 
system of imprisonment?"
"Yes, sir."
"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable 
persistence of Mr. Fowler."
"That was it, sir."
"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, 
and having met you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you
that your interests were the same as his."
"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said Mrs. Toller serenely.
"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a 
ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out."
"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for you have certainly cleared up 
everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, 
Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our 
locus standi now is rather a questionable one."
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the 
door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of 
his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of 
Rucastle's past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle 
were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the 
holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my 
Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OriginalBook.Ru

friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once 
she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private 
school at Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

Для Шерлока Холмса она всегда оставалась «Этой Женщиной». Я редко слышал, чтобы он называл ее каким-либо другим именем. В его глазах она затмевала всех представительниц своего пола.
Не то чтобы он испытывал к Ирэн Адлер какое-либо чувство, близкое к любви. Все чувства, и особенно любовь, были ненавистны его холодному, точному, но удивительно уравновешенному уму.
По-моему, он был самой совершенной мыслящей и наблюдающей машиной, какую когда-либо видел
мир; но в качестве влюбленного он оказался бы не на своем месте. Он всегда говорил о нежных чувствах не иначе, как с презрительной насмешкой, с издевкой. Нежные чувства были в его глазах великолепным объектом для наблюдения, превосходным средством сорвать покров с человеческих побуждений и дел. Но для изощренного мыслителя допустить такое вторжение чувства в свой
утонченный и великолепно налаженный внутренний мир означало бы внести туда смятение, которое
свело бы на нет все завоевания его мысли. Песчинка, попавшая в чувствительный инструмент, или
трещина в одной из его могучих линз – вот что такое была бы любовь для такого человека, как
Холмс. И все же для него существовала одна женщина, и этой женщиной была покойная Иран Адлер,
особа весьма и весьма сомнительной репутации.
За последнее время я редко виделся с Холмсом – моя женитьба отдалила нас друг от друга.
Моего личного безоблачного счастья и чисто семейных интересов, которые возникают у человека,
когда он впервые становится господином собственного домашнего очага, было достаточно, чтобы
поглотить все мое внимание. Между тем Холмс, ненавидевший своей цыганской душой всякую форму светской жизни, оставался жить в нашей квартире на Бейкер-стрит, окруженный грудами своих
старых книг, чередуя недели увлечения кокаином с приступами честолюбия, дремотное состояние
наркомана – с дикой энергией, присущей его натуре.
Как и прежде, он был глубоко увлечен расследованием преступлений. Он отдавал свои огромные способности и необычайный дар наблюдательности поискам нитей к выяснению тех тайн, которые официальной полицией были признаны непостижимыми. Время от времени до меня доходили
смутные слухи о его делах: о том, что его вызывали в Одессу в связи с убийством Трепова, о том, что
ему удалось пролить свет на загадочную трагедию братьев Аткинсон в Тринкомали, и, наконец, о поручении голландского королевского дома, выполненном им исключительно тонко и удачно.
Однако, помимо этих сведений о его деятельности, которые я так же, как и все читатели, черпал
из газет, я мало знал о моем прежнем друге и товарище.
Однажды ночью – это было 20 марта 1888 года – я возвращался от пациента (так как теперь я
вновь занялся частной практикой), и мой путь привел меня на Бейкер-стрит. Когда я проходил мимо
хорошо знакомой двери, которая в моем уме навсегда связана с воспоминанием о времени моего сватовства и с мрачными событиями «Этюда в багровых тонах», меня охватило острое желание вновь
увидеть Холмса и узнать, над какими проблемами нынче работает его замечательный ум. Его окна
были ярко освещены, и, посмотрев вверх, я увидел его высокую, худощавую фигуру, которая дважды
темным силуэтом промелькнула на опущенной шторе. Он быстро, стремительно ходил по комнате,
низко опустив голову и заложив за спину руки. Мне, знавшему все его настроения и привычки, его
ходьба из угла в угол и весь его внешний облик говорили о многом. Он вновь принялся за работу. Он
стряхнул с себя навеянные наркотиками туманные грезы и распутывал нити какой-то новой загадки.
Я позвонил, и меня проводили в комнату, которая когда-то была отчасти и моей.
Он встретил меня без восторженных излияний. Таким излияниям он предавался чрезвычайно
редко, но, мне кажется, был рад моему приходу. Почти без слов, он приветливым жестом пригласил
меня сесть, подвинул ко мне коробку сигар и указал на погребец, где хранилось вино. Затем он встал
перед камином и оглядел меня своим особым, проницательным взглядом.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Then he stood before fire
– Семейная жизнь вам на пользу, – заметил он. – Я думаю, Уотсон, что с тех пор, как я вас видел, вы пополнели на семь с половиной фунтов.
– На семь.
– Правда? Нет, нет, немного больше. Чуточку больше, уверяю вас. И снова практикуете, как я
вижу. Вы мне не говорили, что собираетесь впрячься в работу.
– Так откуда же вы это знаете?
– Я вижу это, я делаю выводы. Например, откуда я знаю, что вы недавно сильно промокли и
что ваша горничная большая неряха?
– Дорогой Холмс, – сказал я, – это уж чересчур. Вас несомненно сожгли бы на костре, если бы
вы жили несколько веков назад. Правда, что в четверг мне пришлось быть за городом и я вернулся
домой весь испачканный, но ведь я переменил костюм, так что от дождя не осталось следов. Что касается Мэри Джен, она и в самом деле неисправима, и жена уже предупредила, что хочет уволить ее.
И все же я не понимаю, как вы догадались об этом.
Холмс тихо рассмеялся и потер свои длинные нервные руки.
– Проще простого! – сказал он. – Мои глаза уведомляют меня, что с внутренней стороны вашего левого башмака, как раз там, куда падает свет, на коже видны шесть почти параллельных царапин.
Очевидно, царапины были сделаны кем-то, кто очень небрежно обтирал края подошвы, чтобы удалить засохшую грязь. Отсюда я, как видите, делаю двойной вывод, что вы выходили в дурную погоду
и что у вас очень скверный образчик лондонской прислуги. А что касается вашей практики, – если в
мою комнату входит джентльмен, пропахший йодоформом, если у него на указательном пальце правой руки черное пятно от азотной кислоты, а на цилиндре – шишка, указывающая, куда он запрятал
свой стетоскоп, я должен быть совершенным глупцом, чтобы не признать в нем деятельного представителя врачебного мира.
Я не мог удержаться от смеха, слушая, с какой легкостью он объяснил мне путь своих умозаключений.
– Когда вы раскрываете свои соображения, – заметил я, – все кажется мне смехотворно простым, я и сам без труда мог бы все это сообразить. А в каждом новом случае я совершенно ошеломлен, пока вы не объясните мне ход ваших мыслей. Между тем я думаю, что зрение у меня не хуже
вашего.
– Совершенно верно, – ответил Холмс, закуривая папиросу и вытягиваясь в кресле. – Вы смотрите, но вы не наблюдаете, а это большая разница. Например, вы часто видели ступеньки, ведущие из
прихожей в эту комнату?
– Часто.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Как часто?
– Ну, несколько сот раз!
– Отлично. Сколько же там ступенек?
– Сколько? Не обратил внимания.
– Вот-вот, не обратили внимания. А между тем вы видели! В этом вся суть. Ну, а я знаю, что
ступенек – семнадцать, потому что я и видел, и наблюдал. Кстати, вы ведь интересуетесь теми небольшими проблемами, в разрешении которых заключается мое ремесло, и даже были добры описать
два-три из моих маленьких опытов. Поэтому вас может, пожалуй, заинтересовать вот это письмо.
Он бросил мне листок толстой розовой почтовой бумаги, валявшийся на столе.
– Получено только что, – сказал он. – Прочитайте-ка вслух.
Письмо было без даты, без подписи и без адреса.
«Сегодня вечером, без четверти восемь, – говорилось в записке, – к Вам придет
джентльмен, который хочет получить у Вас консультацию по очень важному делу. Услуги, оказанные Вами недавно одному из королевских семейств Европы, показали, что Вам
можно доверять дела чрезвычайной важности. Такой отзыв о Вас мы со всех сторон получали. Будьте дома в этот час и не подумайте ничего плохого, если Ваш посетитель будет в маске».
– Это в самом деле таинственно, – заметил я. – Как вы думаете, что все это значит?
– У меня пока нет никаких данных. Теоретизировать, не имея данных, опасно. Незаметно для
себя человек начинает подтасовывать факты, чтобы подогнать их к своей теории, вместо того чтобы
обосновывать теорию фактами. Но сама записка! Какие вы можете сделать выводы из записки?
I carefully examined the writing
Я тщательно осмотрел письмо и бумагу, на которой оно было написано.
– Написавший это письмо, по-видимому, располагает средствами, – заметил я, пытаясь подражать приемам моего друга. – Такая бумага стоит не меньше полкроны за пачку. Очень уж она прочная и плотная.
– Диковинная – самое подходящее слово, – заметил Холмс.
– И это не английская бумага. Посмотрите ее на свет.
Я так и сделал и увидел на бумаге водяные знаки: большое «Е» и маленькое «g», затем «Р» и
большое «G» с маленьким «t».
– Какой вывод вы можете из этого сделать? – спросил Холмс.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Это несомненно имя фабриканта или, скорее, его монограмма.
– Вот и ошиблись! Большое «G» с маленьким «t» – это сокращение «Gesellschaft», что понемецки означает «компания». Это обычное сокращение, как наше «К°». «Р», конечно, означает
«Papier», бумага. Расшифруем теперь «Е». Заглянем в иностранный географический справочник… –
Он достал с полки тяжелый фолиант в коричневом переплете. – Eglow, Eglonitz… Вот мы и нашли:
Egeria. Это местность, где говорят по-немецки, в Богемии, недалеко от Карлсбада.

 славится многочисленными стекольными заводами и бумажными фабриками… Хаха, мой мальчик, какой вы из этого делаете вывод? – Глаза его сверкнули торжеством, и он выпустил
из своей трубки большое синее облако.
– Бумага изготовлена в Богемии, – сказал я.
– Именно. А человек, написавший записку, немец. Вы замечаете странное построение фразы:
«Такой отзыв о вас мы со всех сторон получали»? Француз или русский не мог бы так написать.
Только немцы так бесцеремонно обращаются со своими глаголами. Следовательно, остается только
узнать, что нужно этому немцу, который пишет на богемской бумаге и предпочитает носить маску,
лишь бы не показывать своего лица… Вот и он сам, если я не ошибаюсь. Он разрешит все наши сомнения.
Мы услышали резкий стук лошадиных копыт и визг колес, скользнувших вдоль ближайшей
обочины. Вскоре затем кто-то с силой дернул звонок.
Холмс присвистнул.
– Судя по звуку, парный экипаж… Да, – продолжал он, выглянув в окно, – изящная маленькая
карета и пара рысаков… по сто пятьдесят гиней каждый. Так или иначе, но это дело пахнет деньгами,
Уотсон.
– Я думаю, что мне лучше уйти, Холмс?
– Нет, нет, оставайтесь! Что я стану делать без моего биографа? Дело обещает быть интересным. Будет жаль, если вы пропустите его.
– Но ваш клиент…
– Ничего, ничего. Мне может понадобиться ваша помощь, и ему тоже… Ну, вот он идет. Садитесь в это кресло, доктор, и будьте очень внимательны.
Медленные, тяжелые шаги, которые мы слышали на лестнице и в коридоре, затихли перед самой нашей дверью. Затем раздался громкий и властный стук.
– Войдите! – сказал Холмс.

 геркулесовского сложения. Он был одет роскошно, но эту роскошь сочли бы в Англии вульгарной. Рукава и отвороты его
двубортного пальто были оторочены тяжелыми полосами каракуля; темно-синий плащ, накинутый
на плечи, был подбит огненно-красным шелком и застегнут на шее пряжкой из сверкающего берилла. Сапоги, доходящие до половины икр и обшитые сверху дорогим коричневым мехом, дополняли
то впечатление варварской пышности, которое производил весь его облик. В руке он держал широкополую шляпу, а верхняя часть его лица была закрыта черной маской, опускавшейся ниже скул. Эту
маску, походившую на забрало, он, очевидно, только что надел, потому что, когда он вошел, рука его
была еще поднята. Судя по нижней части лица, это был человек сильной воли: толстая выпяченная
губа и длинный прямой подбородок говорили о решительности, переходящей в упрямство.
– Вы получили мою записку? – спросил он низким, грубым голосом с сильным немецким акцентом. – Я сообщал, что приду к вам. – Он смотрел то на одного из нас, то на другого, видимо не
зная, к кому обратиться.
– Садитесь, пожалуйста. – сказал Холмс. – Это мой друг и товарищ, доктор Уотсон. Он так
добр, что иногда помогает мне в моей работе. С кем имею честь говорить?
– Вы можете считать, что я граф фон Крамм, богемский дворянин. Полагаю, что этот джентльмен, ваш друг, – человек, достойный полного доверия, и я могу посвятить его в дело чрезвычайной
важности? Если это не так, я предпочел бы беседовать с вами наедине.
Я встал, чтобы уйти, но Холмс схватил меня за руку и толкнул обратно в кресло:
– Говорите либо с нами обоими, либо не говорите. В присутствии этого джентльмена вы можете сказать все, что сказали бы мне с глазу на глаз.
Граф пожал широкими плечами.
– В таком случае я должен прежде всего взять с вас обоих слово, что дело, о котором я вам сейчас расскажу, останется в тайне два года. По прошествии двух лет это не будет иметь значения. В настоящее время я могу, не преувеличивая, сказать: вся эта история настолько серьезна, что может отразиться на судьбах Европы.
– Даю слово, – сказал Холмс.
– И я.
– Простите мне эту маску, – продолжал странный посетитель. – Августейшее лицо, по поруче3

нию которого я действую, пожелало, чтобы его доверенный остался для вас неизвестен, и я должен
признаться, что титул, которым я себя назвал, не совсем точен.
– Это я заметил, – сухо сказал Холмс.
– Обстоятельства очень щекотливые, и необходимо принять все меры, чтобы из-за них не разросся огромный скандал, который мог бы сильно скомпрометировать одну из царствующих династий
Европы. Говоря проще, дело связано с царствующим домом Ормштейнов, королей Богемии.
– Так я и думал, – пробормотал Холмс, поудобнее располагаясь в кресле и закрывая глаза.
Посетитель с явным удивлением посмотрел на лениво развалившегося, равнодушного человека,
которого ему, несомненно, описали как самого проницательного и самого энергичного из всех европейских сыщиков. Холмс медленно открыл глаза и нетерпеливо посмотрел на своего тяжеловесного
клиента.
– Если ваше величество соблаговолите посвятить нас в свое дело, – заметил он, – мне легче будет дать вам совет.
Посетитель вскочил со стула и принялся шагать по комнате в сильном возбуждении. Затем с
жестом отчаяния он сорвал с лица маску и швырнул ее на пол.
He tore the mask from his face
– Вы правы, – воскликнул он, – я король! Зачем мне пытаться скрывать это?
– Действительно, зачем? Ваше величество еще не начали говорить, как я уже знал, что передо
мной Вильгельм Готтсрейх Сигизмунд фон Ормштейн, великий князь Кассель-Фельштейнский и наследственный король Богемии.
– Но вы понимаете, – сказал наш странный посетитель, снова усевшись и поводя рукой по высокому белому лбу, – вы понимаете, что я не привык лично заниматься такими делами! Однако вопрос настолько щекотлив, что я не мог доверить его кому-нибудь из полицейских агентов, не рискуя
оказаться в его власти. Я приехал из Праги инкогнито специально затем, чтобы обратиться к вам за
советом.
– Пожалуйста, обращайтесь, – сказал Холмс, снова закрывая глаза.
– Факты вкратце таковы: лет пять назад, во время продолжительного пребывания в Варшаве, я
познакомился с хорошо известной авантюристкой Ирэн Адлер. Это имя вам, несомненно, знакомо?
– Будьте любезны, доктор, посмотрите в моей картотеке, – пробормотал Холмс, не открывая
глаз.
Много лет назад он завел систему регистрации разных фактов, касавшихся людей и вещей, так
что трудно было назвать лицо или предмет, о которых он не мог бы сразу дать сведения. В данном
случае я нашел биографию Ирэн Адлер между биографией еврейского раввина и биографией одного
начальника штаба, написавшего труд о глубоководных рыбах.
– Покажите-ка, – сказал Холмс. – Гм! Родилась в Нью-Джерси в 1858 году. Контральто, гм…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Ла Скала, так-так!.. Примадонна императорской оперы в Варшаве, да! Покинула оперную сцену, ха!
Проживает в Лондоне… совершенно верно! Ваше величество, насколько я понимаю, попали в сети к
этой молодой особе, писали ей компрометирующие письма и теперь желали бы вернуть эти письма.
– Совершенно верно. Но каким образом?
– Вы тайно женились на ней?
– Нет.
– Никаких документов или свидетельств?
– Никаких.
– В таком случае, я вас не понимаю, ваше величество. Если эта молодая женщина захочет использовать письма для шантажа или других целей, как она докажет их подлинность?
– Мой почерк.
– Пустяки! Подлог.
– Моя личная почтовая бумага.
– Украдена.
– Моя личная печать.
– Подделка.
– Моя фотография.
– Куплена.
– Но мы сфотографированы вместе!
– О-о, вот это очень плохо! Ваше величество действительно допустили большую оплошность.
– Я был без ума от Ирэн.
– Вы серьезно себя скомпрометировали.
– Тогда я был всего лишь кронпринцем. Я был молод. Мне и теперь только тридцать.
– Фотографию необходимо во что бы то ни стало вернуть.
– Мы пытались, но нам не удалось.
– Ваше величество должны пойти на издержки: фотографию надо купить.
– Ирэн не желает ее продавать.
– Тогда ее надо выкрасть.
– Было сделано пять попыток. Я дважды нанимал взломщиков, и они перерыли весь ее дом. Раз,
когда она путешествовала, мы обыскали ее багаж. Дважды ее заманивали в ловушку. Мы не добились никаких результатов.
– Никаких?
– Абсолютно никаких.
Холмс засмеялся.
– Ничего себе задачка! – сказал он.
– Но для меня это очень серьезная задача! – с упреком возразил король.
– Да, действительно. А что она намеревается сделать с фотографией?
– Погубить меня.
– Но каким образом?
– Я собираюсь жениться.
– Об этом я слышал.
– На Клотильде Лотман фон Саксен-Менинген. Быть может, вы знаете строгие принципы этой
семьи. Сама Клотильда – воплощенная чистота. Малейшая тень сомнения относительно моего прошлого привела бы к разрыву.
– А Ирэн Адлер?
– Она грозит, что пошлет фотоснимок родителям моей невесты. И пошлет, непременно пошлет!
Вы ее не знаете. У нее железный характер. Да, да, лицо обаятельной женщины, а душа жестокого
мужчины. Она ни перед чем не остановится, лишь бы не дать мне жениться на другой.
– Вы уверены, что она еще не отправила фотографию вашей невесте?
– Уверен.
– Почему?
– Она сказала, что пошлет фотографию в день моей официальной помолвки. А это будет в ближайший понедельник.
– О, у нас остается три дня! – сказал Холмс, зевая. – И это очень приятно, потому что сейчас
мне надо заняться кое-какими важными делами. Ваше величество, конечно, останетесь пока что в
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Лондоне?
– Конечно. Вы можете найти меня в гостинице Лэнгхэм под именем графа фон Крамма.
– В таком случае, я пришлю вам записочку – сообщу, как продвигается дело.
– Очень прошу вас. Я так волнуюсь!
– Ну, а как насчет денег?
– Тратьте, сколько найдете нужным. Вам предоставляется полная свобода действий.
– Абсолютно?
– О, я готов отдать за эту фотографию любую из провинций моего королевства!
– А на текущие расходы?
Король достал из-за плаща тяжелый кожаный мешочек и положил его на стол.
– Здесь триста фунтов золотом и семьсот ассигнациями, – сказал он.
Холмс написал расписку на страничке своей записной книжки и вручил королю.
– Адрес мадемуазель? – спросил он.
– Брайони-лодж, Серпантайн-авеню, Сент-Джонсвуд.
Холмс записал.
– И еще один вопрос, – сказал он. – Фотография была кабинетного размера?
– Да, кабинетного.
– А теперь доброй ночи, ваше величество, к я надеюсь, что скоро у нас будут хорошие вести…
Доброй ночи, Уотсон, – добавил он, когда колеса королевского экипажа застучали по мостовой. –
Будьте любезны зайти завтра в три часа, я бы хотел потолковать с вами об этом деле.
II
Ровно в три часа я был на Бейкер-стрит, но Холмс еще не вернулся. Экономка сообщила мне,
что он вышел из дому в начале девятого. Я уселся у камина с намерением дождаться его, сколько бы
мне ни пришлось ждать. Я глубоко заинтересовался его расследованием, хотя оно было лишено причудливых и мрачных черт, присущих тем двум преступлениям, о которых я рассказал в другом месте.
Но своеобразные особенности этого случая и высокое положение клиента придавали делу необычный характер. Если даже оставить в стороне самое содержание исследования, которое производил
мой друг, – как удачно, с каким мастерством он сразу овладел всей ситуацией и какая строгая, неопровержимая логика была в его умозаключениях! Мне доставляло истинное удовольствие следить за
быстрыми, ловкими приемами, с помощью которых он разгадывал самые запутанные тайны. Я настолько привык к его неизменным триумфам, что самая возможность неудачи не укладывалась у меня в голове.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
A drunken-looked groom
Было около четырех часов, когда дверь отворилась и в комнату вошел подвыпивший грум,
4
 с
бакенбардами, с растрепанной шевелюрой, с воспаленным лицом, одетый бедно и вульгарно. Как ни
привык я к удивительной способности моего друга менять свой облик, мне пришлось трижды вглядеться, прежде чем я удостоверился, что это действительно Холмс. Кивнув мне на ходу, он исчез в
своей спальне, откуда появился через пять минут в темном костюме, корректный, как всегда. Сунув
руки в карманы, он протянул ноги к пылающему камину и несколько минут весело смеялся.
– Чудесно! – воскликнул он, затем закашлялся и снова расхохотался, да так, что под конец
обессилел и в полном изнеможении откинулся на спинку кресла.
– В чем дело?
– Смешно, невероятно смешно! Уверен, что вы никогда не угадаете, как я провел это утро и что
я в конце концов сделал.
– Не могу себе представить. Полагаю, что вы наблюдали за привычками или, может быть, за
домом мисс Ирэн Адлер.
– Совершенно верно, но последствия были довольно необычайные… Однако расскажу по порядку. В начале девятого я вышел из дому под видом безработного грума. Существует удивительная
симпатия, своего рода содружество между всеми, кто имеет дело с лошадьми. Станьте грумом, и вы
узнаете все, что вам надо. Я быстро нашел Брайони-лодж. Это крохотная шикарная двухэтажная вилла; она выходит на улицу, позади нее сад. Массивный замок на садовой калитке. С правой стороны
большая гостиная, хорошо обставленная, с высокими окнами, почти до полу, и с нелепыми английскими оконными затворами, которые мог бы открыть и ребенок. За домом ничего особенного, кроме
того, что к окну галереи можно добраться с крыши каретного сарая. Я обошел этот сарай со всех сторон и рассмотрел его очень внимательно, но ничего интересного не заметил. Затем я пошел вдоль
улицы и увидел, как я и ожидал, в переулке, примыкающем к стене сада, конюшню. Я помог конюхам чистить лошадей и получил за это два пенса, стакан водки, два пакета табаку и вдоволь сведений
о мисс Адлер, а также и о других местных жителях. Местные жители меня не интересовали нисколько, но я был вынужден выслушать их биографии.
– А что вы узнали об Ирэн Адлер? – спросил я.
– О, она вскружила головы всем мужчинам в этой части города. Она самое прелестное существо из всех, носящих дамскую шляпку на этой планете. Так говорят в один голос все серпантайнские
4

Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
конюхи. Она живет тихо, выступает иногда на концертах, ежедневно в пять часов дня выезжает кататься и ровно в семь возвращается к обеду. Редко выезжает в другое время, кроме тех случаев, когда
она поет. Только один мужчина посещает ее – только один, но зато очень часто. Брюнет, красавец,
прекрасно одевается, бывает у нее ежедневно, а порой и по два раза в день. Его зовут мистер Годфри
Нортон из Темпла.
5
 Видите, как выгодно войти в доверие к кучерам! Они его возили домой от серпантайнских конюшен раз двадцать и все о нем знают. Выслушав то, что они мне рассказывали, я
снова стал прогуливаться взад и вперед вблизи Брайони-лодж и обдумывать дальнейшие действия.
Этот Годфри Нортон, очевидно, играет существенную роль во всем деле. Он юрист. Это звучит
зловеще. Что их связывает и какова причина его частых посещений? Кто она: его клиентка? Его
друг? Его возлюбленная? Если она его клиентка, То, вероятно, отдала ему на хранение ту фотографию. Если же возлюбленная – едва ли. От решения этого вопроса зависит, продолжать ли мне работу
в Брайони-лодж или обратить внимание на квартиру того джентльмена в Темпле. Этот вопрос очень
щекотлив и расширяет поле моих розысков… Боюсь, Уотсон, что надоедаю вам этими подробностями, но, чтобы вы поняли всю ситуацию, я должен открыть вам мои мелкие затруднения.
– Я внимательно слежу за вашим рассказом, – ответил я.
– Я все еще взвешивал в уме это дело, когда к Брайони-лодж подкатил изящный экипаж и из
него выскочил какой-то джентльмен, необычайно красивый, усатый, смуглый, с орлиным носом.
Очевидно, это и был тот субъект, о котором я слышал. По-видимому, он очень спешил и был крайне
взволнован. Приказав кучеру ждать, он пробежал мимо горничной, открывшей ему дверь, с видом
человека, который чувствует себя в этом доме хозяином.
Он пробыл там около получаса, и мне было видно через окно гостиной, как он ходит взад и
вперед по комнате, возбужденно толкует о чем-то и размахивает руками. Ее я не видел. Но вот он
вышел на улицу, еще более взволнованный. Подойдя к экипажу, он вынул из кармана золотые часы и
озабоченно посмотрел на них. «Гоните, как дьявол! – крикнул он кучеру. – Сначала к Гроссу и Хенке
на Риджент-стрит, а затем к церкви святой Моники на Эджвер-роуд. Полгинеи, если доедете за двадцать минут!»
Они умчались, а я как раз соображал, не последовать ли мне за ними, как вдруг к дому подкатило прелестное маленькое ландо.
6
 Пальто на кучере было полуэастегнуто, узел галстука торчал под
самым ухом, а ремни упряжи выскочили из пряжек. Кучер едва успел остановить лошадей, как Ирэн
выпорхнула из дверей виллы и вскочила в ландо. Я видел ее лишь одно мгновение, но а этого было
довольно: очень миловидная женщина с таким лицом, в которое мужчины влюбляются до смерти.
«Церковь святой Моники, Джон! – крикнула она. – Полгинеи, если доедете за двадцать минут!»
Это был случай, которого нельзя было упустить, Уотсон. Я уже начал раздумывать, что лучше:
бежать за ней вслед или прицепиться к задку ландо, как вдруг на улице показался кэб. Кучер дважды
посмотрел на такого неказистого седока, но я вскочил прежде, чем он успел что-либо возразить.
«Церковь святой Моники, – сказал я, – и полгинеи, если вы доедете за двадцать минут!» Было без
двадцати пяти минут двенадцать, и, конечно, нетрудно было догадаться, в чем дело.
Мой кэб мчался стрелой. Не думаю, чтобы когда-нибудь я ехал быстрее, но экипаж и ландо со
взмыленными лошадьми уже стояли у входа в церковь. Я рассчитался с кучером и взбежал по ступеням. В церкви не было ни души, кроме тех, за кем я следовал, да священника, который, по-видимому,
обращался к ним с какими-то упреками. Все трое стояли перед алтарем. Я стал бродить по боковому
приделу, как праздношатающийся, случайно зашедший в церковь. Внезапно, к моему изумлению, те
трое обернулись ко мне, и Годфри Нортон со всех ног бросился в мою сторону.
«Слава богу! – закричал он. – Вас-то нам и нужно. Идемте! Идемте!»
«В чем дело?» – спросил я.
«Идите, идите, добрый человек, всего три минуты!»
Меня чуть не силой потащили к алтарю, и, еще не успев опомниться, я бормотал ответы, которые мне шептали в ухо, клялся в том, чего совершенно не знал, и вообще помогал бракосочетанию
Ирэн Адлер, девицы, с Годфри Нортоном, холостяком.
Все это совершилось в одну минуту, и вот джентльмен благодарит меня с одной стороны, леди
– с другой, а священник так и сияет улыбкой. Это было самое нелепое положение, в каком я когда5

либо находился; воспоминание о нем и заставило меня сейчас хохотать. По-видимому, у них не были
выполнены какие-то формальности, и священник наотрез отказался совершить обряд бракосочетания, если не будет свидетеля. Мое удачное появление в церкви избавило жениха от необходимости
бежать на улицу в поисках первого встречного. Невеста дала мне гинею, и я собираюсь носить эту
монету на часовой цепочке как память о своем приключении.
I found myself mumbling responses
– Дело приняло весьма неожиданный оборот, – сказал я. – Что же будет дальше?
– Ну, я понял, что мои планы под серьезной угрозой. Похоже было на то, что молодожены собираются немедленно уехать, и потому с моей стороны требовались быстрые и энергичные действия.
Однако у дверей церкви они расстались: он уехал в Темпл, она – к себе домой. «Я поеду кататься в
парк, как всегда, в пять часов», – сказала она, прощаясь с ним. Больше я ничего не слыхал. Они разъехались в разные стороны, а я вернулся, чтобы взяться за свои приготовления.
– В чем они заключаются?
– Немного холодного мяса и стакан пива, – ответил Холмс, дергая колокольчик. – Я был слишком занят и совершенно забыл о еде. Вероятно, сегодня вечером у меня будет еще больше хлопот.
Кстати, доктор, мне понадобится ваше содействие.
– Буду очень рад.
– Вы не боитесь нарушать законы?
– Ничуть.
– И опасность ареста вас не пугает?
– Ради хорошего дела готов и на это.
– О, дело великолепное!
– В таком случае, я к вашим услугам.
– Я был уверен, что могу на вас положиться.
– Но что вы задумали?
– Когда миссис Тернер принесет ужин, я вам все объясню… Теперь, – сказал он, жадно накидываясь на скромную пищу, приготовленную экономкой, – я должен во время еды обсудить с вами
все дело, потому что времени у меня осталось мало. Сейчас без малого пять часов. Через два часа мы
должны быть на месте. Мисс Ирэн или, скорее, миссис, возвращается со своей прогулки в семь часов.
Мы должны быть у Брайони-лодж, чтобы встретить ее.
– Что же дальше?
– А это предоставьте мне. Я уже подготовил то, что должно произойти. Я настаиваю только на
одном: что бы ни случилось– не вмешивайтесь. Вы понимаете?
– Я должен быть нейтрален?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Вот именно. Не делать ничего. Вероятно, получится небольшая неприятность. Не вмешивайтесь. Кончится тем, что меня отнесут в дом. Через четыре или пять минут откроют окно гостиной. Вы
должны стать поближе к этому открытому окну.
– Хорошо.
– Вы должны наблюдать за мною, потому что я буду у вас на виду.
– Хорошо.
– И когда я подниму руку – вот так, – вы бросите в комнату то, что я вам дам для этой цели, и в
то же время закричите: «Пожар!» Вы меня понимаете?
– Вполне.
– Тут ничего нет опасного, – сказал он, вынимая из кармана сверток в форме сигары. – Это
обыкновенная дымовая ракета, снабженная с обоих концов капсюлем, чтобы она сама собою воспламенялась. Вся ваша работа сводится к этому. Когда вы закричите «Пожар!», ваш крик будет подхвачен множеством людей, после чего вы можете дойти до конца улицы, а я нагоню вас через десять
минут. Надеюсь, вы поняли?
– Я должен оставаться нейтральным, подойти поближе к окну, наблюдать за вами и по вашему
сигналу бросить в окно этот предмет, затем поднять крик о пожаре и ожидать вас на углу улицы.
– Совершенно верно.
– Можете на меня положиться.
– Ну, и отлично. Пожалуй, мне пора уже начать подготовку к новой роли, которую придется сегодня играть.
A simple-minded clergyman
Он скрылся в спальне и через несколько минут появился в виде любезного, простоватого священника. Его широкополая черная шляпа, мешковатые брюки, белый галстук, привлекательная
улыбка и общее выражение благожелательного любопытства были бесподобны. Дело не только в
том, что Холмс переменил костюм. Выражение его лица, манеры, самая душа, казалось, изменялись
при каждой новой роли, которую ему приходилось играть. Сцена потеряла в его лице прекрасного
актера, а наука – тонкого мыслителя, когда он стал специалистом по расследованию преступлений.
В четверть седьмого мы вышли из дому, и до назначенного часа оставалось десять минут, когда
мы оказались на Серпантайн-авеню. Уже смеркалось, на улице только что зажглись фонари, и мы
принялись расхаживать мимо Брайони-лодж, поджидая возвращения его обитателей. Дом был как раз
такой, каким я его себе представлял по краткому описанию Шерлока Холмса, но местность оказалась
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
далеко не такой безлюдной, как я ожидал. Наоборот: эта маленькая, тихая улица на окраине города
буквально кишела народом. На одном углу курили и смеялись какие-то оборванцы, тут же был точильщик со своим колесом, два гвардейца, флиртовавших с нянькой, и несколько хорошо одетых молодых людей, расхаживавших взад и вперед с сигарами во рту.
– Видите ли, – заметил Холмс, когда мы бродили перед домом, – эта свадьба значительно упрощает все дело. Теперь фотография становится обоюдоострым оружием. Возможно, что Иран так
же не хочется, чтобы фотографию увидел мистер Годфри Нортон, как не хочется нашему клиенту,
чтобы она попалась на глаза его принцессе. Вопрос теперь в том, где мы найдем фотографию.
– Действительно, где?
– Совершенно невероятно, чтобы Ирэн носила ее при себе. Фотография кабинетного формата
слишком велика, и ее не спрятать под женским платьем. Ирэн знает, что король способен заманить ее
куда-нибудь и обыскать. Две попытки такого рода уже были сделаны. Значит, мы можем быть уверены, что с собой она фотографию не носит.
– Ну, а где же она ее хранит?
– У своего банкира или у своего адвоката. Возможно и то и другое, но я сомневаюсь и в томи в
другом. Женщины по своей природе склонны к таинственности и любят окружать себя секретами.
Зачем ей посвящать в свой секрет кого-нибудь другого? Она могла положиться на собственное умение хранить вещи, но вряд ли у нее была уверенность, что деловой человек, если она вверит ему
свою тайну, сможет устоять против политического или какого-нибудь иного влияния. Кроме того,
вспомните, что она решила пустить в ход фотоснимок в ближайшие дни. Для этого нужно держать
его под рукой. Фотоснимок должен быть в ее собственном доме.
– Но два раза взломщики перерыли дом.
– Чепуха! Они не знали, как надо искать.
– А как вы будете искать?
– Я не буду искать.
– А как же иначе?
– Я сделаю так, что Ирэн покажет его мне сама.
– Она откажется.
– В том-то и дело, что ей это не удастся… Но, я слышу, стучат колеса. Это ее карета. Теперь в
точности выполняйте мои указания.
В эту минуту свет боковых фонарей кареты показался на повороте, нарядное маленькое ландо
подкатило к дверям Брайони-лодж. Когда экипаж остановился, один из бродяг, стоявших на углу,
бросился открывать дверцы в надежде заработать медяк, но его оттолкнул другой бродяга, подбежавший с тем же намерением. Завязалась жестокая драка. Масла в огонь подлили оба гвардейца,
ставшие на сторону одного из бродяг, и точильщик, который с такой же горячностью принялся защищать другого. В одно мгновение леди, вышедшая из экипажа, оказалась в свалке разгоряченных,
дерущихся людей, которые дико лупили друг друга кулаками и палками. Холмс бросился в толпу,
чтобы защитить леди. Но, пробившись к ней, он вдруг испустил крик и упал на землю с залитым кровью лицом. Когда он упал, солдаты бросились бежать в одну сторону, оборванцы – в другую. Несколько прохожих более приличного вида, не принимавших участия в потасовке, подбежали, чтобы
защитить леди и оказать помощь раненому. Ирэн Адлер, как я буду по-прежнему ее называть, взбежала по ступенькам, но остановилась на площадке и стала смотреть на улицу; ее великолепная фигура выделялась на фоне освещенной гостиной.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He gave a cry and dropped
– Бедный джентльмен сильно ранен? – спросила она.
– Он умер, – ответило несколько голосов.
– Нет, нет, он еще жив! – крикнул кто-то. – Но он умрет раньше, чем вы его довезете до больницы.
– Вот смелый человек! – сказала какая-то женщина. – Если бы не он, они отобрали бы у леди и
кошелек и часы. Их тут целая шайка и очень опасная. А-а, он стал дышать!
– Ему нельзя лежать на улице… Вы позволите перенести его в дом, мадам?
– Конечно! Перенесите его в гостиную. Там удобный диван. Сюда, пожалуйста!
Медленно и торжественно Холмса внесли в Брайони-лодж и уложили в гостиной, между тем
как я все еще наблюдал за происходившим со своего поста у окна. Лампы были зажжены, но шторы
не были опущены, так что я мог видеть Холмса, лежащего на диване. Не знаю, упрекала ли его совесть за то, что он играл такую роль, – я же ни разу в жизни не испытывал более глубокого стыда,
чем в те минуты, когда эта прелестная женщина, в заговоре против которой я участвовал, ухаживала
с такой добротой и лаской за раненым. И все же было бы черной изменой, если бы я не выполнил поручения Холмса. С тяжелым сердцем я достал из-под моего пальто дымовую ракету. «В конце концов, – подумал я, – мы не причиняем ей вреда, мы только мешаем ей повредить другому человеку».
Холмс приподнялся на диване, и я увидел, что он делает движения, как человек, которому не
хватает воздуха. Служанка бросилась к окну и широко распахнула его. В то же мгновение Холмс
поднял руку; по этому сигналу я бросил в комнату ракету и крикнул: «Пожар!» Едва это слово успело слететь с моих уст, как его подхватила вся толпа. Хорошо и плохо одетые джентльмены, конюхи и
служанки – все завопили в один голос: «Пожар!» Густые облака дыма клубились в комнате и вырывались через открытое окно. Я видел, как там, за окном, мечутся люди; мгновением позже послышался голос Холмса, уверявшего, что это ложная тревога.
Проталкиваясь сквозь толпу, я добрался до угла улицы. Через десять минут, к моей радости,
меня догнал Холмс, взял под руку, и мы покинули место бурных событий. Некоторое время он шел
быстро и не проронил ни единого слова, пока мы не свернули в одну из тихих улиц, ведущих на Эджвер-роуд.
– Вы очень ловко это проделали, доктор, – заметил Холмс.
– Как нельзя лучше. Все в порядке.
– Достали фотографию?
– Я знаю, где она спрятана.
– А как вы узнали?
– Ирэн мне сама показала, как я вам предсказывал.
– Я все же ничего не понимаю.
– Я не делаю из этого никакой тайны, – сказал он, смеясь. – Все было очень просто. Вы, навер-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
но, догадались, что все эти зеваки на улице были моими сообщниками. Все они были наняты мною.
– Об этом-то я догадался.
– В руке у меня было немного влажной красной краски. Когда началась свалка, я бросился вперед, упал, прижал руку к лицу и предстал окровавленный… Старый прием.
– Это я тоже смекнул…
– Они вносят меня в дом. Ирэн Адлер вынуждена принять меня, что ей остается делать? Я попадаю в гостиную, в ту самую комнату, которая была у меня на подозрении. Фотография где-то поблизости, либо в гостиной, либо в спальне. Я твердо решил выяснить, где именно. Меня укладывают
на кушетку, я притворяюсь, что мне не хватает воздуха. Они вынуждены открыть окно, и вы получаете возможность сделать свое дело.
– А что вы от этого выиграли?
– Очень много. Когда женщина думает, что у нее в доме пожар, инстинкт заставляет ее спасать
то, что ей всего дороже. Это самый властный импульс, и я не раз извлекал из него пользу. В случае
дарлингтоновского скандала я использовал его, также и в деле с арнсворским дворцом. Замужняя
женщина спасает ребенка, незамужняя – шкатулку с драгоценностями. Теперь мне ясно, что для нашей леди в доме нет ничего дороже того, что мы ищем. Она бросилась спасать именно это. Пожарная
тревога была отлично разыграна. Дыма и крика было достаточно, чтобы потрясти стальные нервы.
Ирэн поступила точно так, как я ждал. Фотография находится в тайничке, за выдвижной дощечкой,
как раз над шнурком от звонка. Ирэн в одно мгновение очутилась там, и я даже увидел краешек фотографии, когда она наполовину вытащила ее. Когда же я закричал, что это ложная тревога, Ирэн положила фотографию обратно, глянула мельком на ракету, выбежала из комнаты, и после этого я ее не
видел. Я встал и, извинившись, выскользнул из дома. Мне хотелось сразу достать фотографию, но в
комнату вошел кучер и начал зорко следить за мною, так что мне поневоле пришлось отложить свой
налет до другого раза. Излишняя поспешность может погубить все.
– Ну, а дальше? – спросил я.
– Практически наши розыски закончены. Завтра я приду к Ирэн Адлер с королем и с вами, если
вы пожелаете нас сопровождать. Нас попросят подождать в гостиной, но весьма вероятно, что, выйдя
к нам, леди не найдет ни нас, ни фотографии. Возможно, что его величеству будет приятно своими
собственными руками достать фотографию.
– А когда вы отправитесь туда?
– В восемь часов утра. Она еще будет в постели, так что нам обеспечена полная свобода действий. Кроме того, надо действовать быстро, потому что брак может полностью изменить ее быт и ее
привычки. Я должен немедленно послать королю телеграмму.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Good-night, Mister Herlock Holmes»
Мы дошли до Бейкер-стрит и остановились у дверей нашего дома. Холмс искал в карманах
свой ключ, когда какой-то прохожий сказал:
– Доброй ночи, мистер Шерлок Холмс!
На панели в это время было несколько человек, но приветствие, по-видимому, исходило от
проходившего мимо стройного юноши в длинном пальто.
– Я где-то уже слышал этот голос, – сказал Холмс, оглядывая скудно освещенную улицу, – но
не понимаю, черт возьми, кто бы это мог быть.
III
Эту ночь я спал на Бейкер-стрит. Мы сидели утром за кофе с гренками, когда в комнату стремительно вошел король Богемии.
– Вы действительно добыли фотографию? – воскликнул он, обнимая Шерлока Холмса за плечи
и весело глядя ему в лицо.
– Нет еще.
– Но вы надеетесь ее достать?
– Надеюсь.
– В таком случае, идемте! Я сгораю от нетерпения.
– Нам нужна карета.
– Мой экипаж у дверей.
– Это упрощает дело.
Мы сошли вниз и снова направились к Брайони-лодж.
– Ирэн Адлер вышла замуж, – заметил Холмс.
– Замуж? Когда?
– Вчера.
– За кого?
– За английского адвоката, по имени Нортон.
– Но она, конечно, не любит его?
– Надеюсь, что любит.
– Почему вы надеетесь?
– Потому что это избавит ваше величество от всех будущих неприятностей. Если леди любит
своего мужа, значит, она не любит ваше величество, и тогда у нее нет основания мешать планам вашего величества.
– Верно, верно. И все же… О, как я хотел бы, чтобы она была одного ранга со мною! Какая бы
это была королева!
Он погрузился в угрюмое молчание, которого не прерывал, пока мы не выехали на Серпантайнавеню.
Двери виллы Брайони-лодж были открыты, и на лестнице стояла пожилая женщина. Она с какой-то странной иронией смотрела на нас, пока мы выходили из экипажа.
– Мистер Шерлок Холмс? – спросила она.
– Да, я Шерлок Холмс, – ответил мой друг, смотря на нее вопрошающим и удивленным взглядом.
– Так и есть! Моя хозяйка предупредила меня, что вы, вероятно, зайдете. Сегодня утром, в пять
часов пятнадцать минут, она уехала со своим мужем на континент с Черингкросского вокзала.
– Что?! – Шерлок Холмс отшатнулся назад, бледный от огорчения и неожиданности. – Вы хотите сказать, что она покинула Англию?
– Да. Навсегда.
– А бумаги? – хрипло спросил король. – Все потеряно!
– Посмотрим! – Холмс быстро прошел мимо служанки и бросился в гостиную.
Мы с королем следовали за ним. Вся мебель в комнате была беспорядочно сдвинута, полки
стояли пустые, ящики были раскрыты – видно, хозяйка второпях рылась в них, перед тем как пуститься в бегство.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Холмс бросился к шнурку звонка, отодвинул маленькую выдвижную планку и, засунув в тайничок руку, вытащил фотографию и письмо. Это была фотография Ирэн Адлер в вечернем платье, а
на письме была надпись: «Мистеру Шерлоку Холмсу. Вручить ему, когда он придет».
Мой друг разорвал конверт, и мы все трое принялись читать письмо. Оно было датировано минувшей ночью, и вот что было в нем написано:
«Дорогой мистер Шерлок Холмс, вы действительно великолепно все это разыграли.
На первых порах я отнеслась к вам с доверием. До пожарной тревоги у меня не было никаких подозрений. Но затем, когда я поняла, как выдала себя, я не могла не задуматься.
Уже несколько месяцев назад меня предупредили, что если король решит прибегнуть к
агенту, он, конечно, обратится к вам. Мне дали ваш адрес. И все же вы заставили меня
открыть то, что вы хотели узнать. Несмотря на мои подозрения, я не хотела дурно думать
о таком милом, добром, старом священнике… Но вы знаете, я сама была актрисой. Мужской костюм для меня не новость. Я часто пользуюсь той свободой, которую он дает. Я
послала кучера Джона следить за вами, а сама побежала наверх, надела мой костюм для
прогулок, как я его называю, и спустилась вниз, как раз когда вы уходили. Я следовала за
вами до ваших дверей и убедилась, что мною действительно интересуется знаменитый
Шерлок Холмс. Затем я довольно неосторожно пожелала вам доброй ночи и поехала в
Темпл, к мужу.
Мы решили, что, поскольку нас преследует такой сильный противник, лучшим спасением будет бегство. И вот, явившись завтра, вы найдете гнездо опустевшим. Что касается фотографии, то ваш клиент может быть спокоен: я люблю человека, который лучше
его. Человек этот любит меня. Король может делать все, что ему угодно, не опасаясь препятствий со стороны той, кому он причинил столько зла. Я сохраняю у себя фотографию
только ради моей безопасности, ради того, чтобы у меня осталось оружие, которое защитит меня в будущем от любых враждебных шагов короля. Я оставляю здесь другую фотографию, которую ему, может быть, будет приятно сохранить у себя, и остаюсь, дорогой
мистер Шерлок Холмс,
преданная вам
Ирэн Нортон, урожденная Адлер».
– Что за женщина, о, что за женщина! – воскликнул король Богемии, когда мы все трое прочитали это послание. – Разве я не говорил вам, что она находчива, умна и предприимчива? Разве она не
была бы восхитительной королевой? Разве не жаль, что она не одного ранга со мной?
– Насколько я узнал эту леди, мне кажется, что она действительно совсем другого уровня, чем
ваше величество, – холодно сказал Холмс. – Я сожалею, что не мог довести дело вашего величества
до более удачного завершения.
– Наоборот, дорогой сэр! – воскликнул король. – Большей удачи не может быть. Я знаю, что ее
слово нерушимо. Фотография теперь так же безопасна, как если бы она была сожжена.
– Я рад слышать это от вашего величества.
– Я бесконечно обязан вам. Пожалуйста, скажите мне, как я могу вознаградить вас? Это кольцо…
Он снял с пальца изумрудное кольцо и поднес его на ладони Холмсу.
– У вашего величества есть нечто еще более ценное для меня, – сказал Холмс.
– Вам стоит только указать.
– Эта фотография.
Король посмотрел на него с изумлением.
– Фотография Ирэн?! – воскликнул он. – Пожалуйста, если она вам нужна.
– Благодарю, ваше величество. В таком случае, с этим делом покончено. Имею честь пожелать
вам всего лучшего.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«This photograph!»
Холмс поклонился и, не замечая руки, протянутой ему королем, вместе со мною отправился
домой.
Вот рассказ о том, как в королевстве Богемии чуть было не разразился очень громкий скандал и
как хитроумные планы мистера Шерлока Холмса были разрушены мудростью женщины. Холмс вечно подшучивал над женским умом, но за последнее время я уже не слышу его издевательств. И когда
он говорит об Ирэн Адлер или вспоминает ее фотографию, то всегда произносит, как почетный титул: «Эта Женщина».
Союз рыжих
The Red-headed League
First published in the Strand Magazine, Aug. 1891,
with 10 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
Это было осенью прошлого года. У Шерлока Холмса сидел какой-то пожилой джентльмен,
очень полный, огненно-рыжий. Я хотел было войти, но увидел, что оба они увлечены разговором, и
поспешил удалиться. Однако Холмс втащил меня в комнату и закрыл за мной дверь.
– Вы пришли как нельзя более кстати, мой дорогой Уотсон, – приветливо проговорил он.
– Я боялся вам помешать. Мне показалось, что вы заняты.
– Да, я занят. И даже очень.
– Не лучше ли мне подождать в другой комнате?
– Нет, нет… Мистер Уилсон, – сказал он, обращаясь к толстяку, – этот джентльмен не раз оказывал мне дружескую помощь во многих моих наиболее удачных исследованиях. Не сомневаюсь, что
и в вашем деле он будет мне очень полезен.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Mr. Jabez Wilson
Толстяк привстал со стула и кивнул мне головой; его маленькие, заплывшие жиром глазки
пытливо оглядели меня.
– Садитесь сюда, на диван, – сказал Холмс.
Он опустился в кресло и, как всегда в минуты задумчивости, сложил концы пальцев обеих рук
вместе.
– Я знаю, мой дорогой Уотсон, – сказал он, – что вы разделяете мою любовь ко всему необычному, ко всему, что нарушает однообразие нашей будничной жизни. Если бы у вас не было этой
любви к необыкновенным событиям, вы не стали бы с таким энтузиазмом записывать скромные мои
приключения… причем по совести должен сказать, что иные из ваших рассказов изображают мою
деятельность в несколько приукрашенном виде.
– Право же, ваши приключения всегда казались мне такими интересными, – возразил я.
– Не далее, как вчера, я, помнится, говорил вам, что самая смелая фантазия не в силах представить себе тех необычайных и диковинных случаев, какие встречаются в обыденной жизни.
– Я тогда же ответил вам, что позволяю себе усомниться в правильности вашего мнения.
– И тем не менее, доктор, вам придется признать, что я прав, ибо в противном случае я обрушу
на вас такое множество удивительных фактов, что вы будете вынуждены согласиться со мной. Вот
хотя бы та история, которую мне сейчас рассказал мистер Джабез Уилсон. Обстановка, где она произошла, совершенно заурядная и будничная, а между тем мне сдается, что за всю свою жизнь я не
слыхал более чудесной истории… Будьте добры, мистер Уилсон, повторите свой рассказ. Я прошу
вас об этом не только для того, чтобы мой друг, доктор Уотсон, выслушал рассказ с начала до конца,
но и для того, чтобы мне самому не упустить ни малейшей подробности. Обычно, едва мне начинают
рассказывать какой-нибудь случай, тысячи подобных же случаев возникают в моей памяти. Но на
этот раз я вынужден признать, что ничего похожего я никогда не слыхал.
Толстый клиент с некоторой гордостью выпятил грудь, вытащил из внутреннего кармана пальто грязную, скомканную газету и разложил ее у себя на коленях. Пока он, вытянув шею, пробегал
глазами столбцы объявлений, я внимательно разглядывал его и пытался, подражая Шерлоку Холмсу,
угадать по его одежде и внешности, кто он такой.
К сожалению, мои наблюдения не дали почти никаких результатов. Сразу можно было заметить, что наш посетитель – самый заурядный мелкий лавочник, самодовольный, тупой и медлительный. Брюки у него были мешковатые, серые, в клетку. Его не слишком опрятный черный сюртук был
расстегнут, а на темном жилете красовалась массивная цепь накладного золота, на которой в качестве брелока болтался просверленный насквозь четырехугольный кусочек какого-то металла. Его поношенный цилиндр и выцветшее бурое пальто со сморщенным бархатным воротником были брошены тут же на стуле. Одним словом, сколько я ни разглядывал этого человека, я не видел в нем ничего
примечательного, кроме пламенно-рыжих волос. Было ясно, что он крайне озадачен каким-то неприятным событием.
От проницательного взора Шерлока Холмса не ускользнуло мое занятие.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Конечно, для всякого ясно, – сказал он с улыбкой, – что наш гость одно время занимался физическим трудом, что он нюхает табак, что он франкмасон,
7
 что он был в Китае и что за последние
месяцы ему приходилось много писать. Кроме этих очевидных фактов, я не мог отгадать ничего.
Мистер Джабез Уилсон вскочил с кресла и, не отрывая указательного пальца от газеты, уставился на моего приятеля.
– Каким образом, мистер Холмс, могли вы все это узнать? – спросил он. – Откуда вы знаете,
например, что я занимался физическим трудом? Да, действительно, я начал свою карьеру корабельным плотником.
– Ваши руки рассказали мне об этом, мой дорогой сэр. Ваша правая рука больше левой. Вы работали ею, и мускулы на ней сильнее развиты.
– А нюханье табаку? А франкмасонство?
– О франкмасонстве догадаться нетрудно, так как вы, вопреки строгому уставу вашего общества, носите запонку с изображением дуги и окружности.
8
– Ах да! Я и забыл про нее… Но как вы отгадали, что мне приходилось много писать?
– О чем ином может свидетельствовать ваш лоснящийся правый рукав и протертое до гладкости сукно на левом рукаве возле локтя!
– А Китай?
– Только в Китае могла быть вытатуирована та рыбка, что красуется на вашем правом запястье.
Я изучил татуировки, и мне приходилось даже писать о них научные статьи. Обычай окрашивать рыбью чешую нежно-розовым цветом свойствен одному лишь Китаю. Увидев китайскую монетку на
цепочке ваших часов, я окончательно убедился, что вы были в Китае.
Мистер Джабез Уилсон громко расхохотался.
– Вот оно что! – сказал он. – Я сначала подумал, что вы бог знает какими мудреными способами отгадываете, а, оказывается, это так просто.
– Я думаю, Уотсон, – сказал Холмс, – что совершил ошибку, объяснив, каким образом я пришел к моим выводам. Как вам известно, «Omne ignotum pro magnifico",9
 и моей скромной славе грозит крушение, если я буду так откровенен… Вы нашли объявление, мистер Уилсон?
– Нашел, – ответил тот, держа толстый красный палец в центре газетного столбца. – Вот оно. С
этого все и началось. Прочтите его сами, сэр.
Я взял газету и прочел:
Союз Рыжих во исполнение завещания покойного Иезекин Хопкинса из Лебанона,
Пенсильвания (США).
Открыта новая вакансия для члена Союза Предлагается жалованье четыре фунта
стерлингов в неделю за чисто номинальную работу. Каждый рыжий не моложе двадцати
одного года, находящийся в здравом уме и трезвой памяти, может оказаться пригодным
для этой работы. Обращаться лично к Дункану Россу в понедельник, в одиннадцать часов, в контору Союза, Флитстрит, Попс-корт, 7.
– Что это, черт побери, может означать? – воскликнул я, дважды прочитав необычайное объявление.
Холмс беззвучно засмеялся и весь как-то съежился в кресле, а это служило верным признаком,
что он испытывает немалое удовольствие.
– Не слишком заурядное объявление, как по-вашему, а? – сказал он. – Ну, мистер Уилсон, продолжайте вашу повесть и расскажите нам о себе, о своем доме и о том, какую роль сыграло это объявление в вашей жизни. А вы, доктор, запишите, пожалуйста, что это за газета и от какого числа.

Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– «Утренняя хроника». 27 апреля 1890 года. Ровно два месяца назад.
– Отлично. Продолжайте, мистер Уилсон.
– Как я вам уже говорил, мистер Шерлок Холмс, – сказал Джабез Уилсон, вытирая лоб, – у меня есть маленькая ссудная касса на Сэкс-Кобург-сквер, неподалеку от Сити. Дело у меня и прежде
шло неважно, а за последние два года доходов с него хватало только на то, чтобы кое-как сводить
концы с концами. Когда-то я держал двух помощников, но теперь у меня только один; мне трудно
было бы платить и ему, но он согласился работать на половинном жалованье, чтобы иметь возможность изучить мое дело.
«What on earth does this mean?»
– Как зовут этого услужливого юношу? – спросил Шерлок Холмс.
– Его зовут Винсент Сполдинг, и он далеко не юноша. Трудно сказать, сколько ему лет. Более
расторопного помощника мне не сыскать. Я отлично понимаю, что он вполне мог бы обойтись без
меня и зарабатывать вдвое больше. Но, в конце концов, раз он доволен, зачем же я стану внушать
ему мысли, которые нанесут ущерб моим интересам?
– В самом деле, зачем? Вам, я вижу, очень повезло: у вас есть помощник, которому вы платите
гораздо меньше, чем платят за такую же работу другие. Не часто встречаются в наше время такие
бескорыстные служащие.
– О, у моего помощника есть свои недостатки! – сказал мистер Уилсон. – Я никогда не встречал
человека, который так страстно увлекался бы фотографией. Щелкает аппаратом, когда нужно работать, а потом ныряет в погреб, как кролик в нору, и проявляет пластинки. Это его главный недостаток. Но в остальном он хороший работник.
– Надеюсь, он и теперь еще служит у вас?
– Да, сэр. Он да девчонка четырнадцати лет, которая кое-как стряпает и подметает полы. Больше никого у меня нет, я вдовец и к тому же бездетный. Мы трое живем очень тихо, сэр, поддерживаем огонь в очаге и платим по счетам – вот и все наши заслуги… Это объявление выбило нас из колеи, – продолжал мистер Уилсон. – Сегодня исполнилось как раз восемь недель с того Дня, когда
Сполдинг вошел в контору с этой газетой в руке и сказал: «Хотел бы я, мистер Уилсон, чтобы господь создал меня рыжим».
«Почему?» – спрашиваю я.
«Да вот, – говорит он, – открылась новая вакансия в Союзе рыжих. Тому, кто займет ее, она
даст недурные доходы. Там, похоже, больше вакансий, чем кандидатов, и душеприказчики ломают
себе голову, не зная, что делать с деньгами. Если бы волосы мои способны были изменить свой цвет,
я непременно воспользовался бы этим выгодным местом».
«Что это за Союз рыжих?» – спросил я. – Видите ли, мистер Холмс, я большой домосед, и так
как мне не приходится бегать за клиентами, клиенты сами приходят ко мне, я иногда по целым неде-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
лям не переступаю порога. Вот почему я мало знаю о том, что делается на свете, и всегда рад услышать что-нибудь новенькое…
«Неужели вы никогда не слыхали о Союзе рыжих?» – спросил Сполдинг, широко раскрыв глаза.
«Никогда».
The League has a vacancy.
«Это очень меня удивляет, так как вы один из тех, что имеет право занять вакансию».
«А много ли это может дать?» – спросил я.
«Около двухсот фунтов стерлингов в год, не больше, но работа пустяковая и притом такая, что
не мешает человеку заниматься любым другим делом».
«Расскажите мне все, что вы знаете об этом Союзе», – сказал я.
«Как вы видите сами, – ответил Сполдинг, показывая мне объявление, – в Союзе рыжих имеется вакантное место, а вот и адрес, по которому вы можете обратиться за справкой, если хотите узнать
все подробности. Насколько мне известно, этот Союз был основан американским миллионером Иезекией Хопкинсом, большим чудаком. Он сам был огненно-рыжий и сочувствовал всем рыжим на свете. Умирая, он оставил своим душеприказчикам огромную сумму и завещал употребить ее на облегчение участи тех, у кого волосы ярко-рыжего цвета. Мне говорили, что этим счастливцам платят
превосходное жалованье, а работы не требуют с них почти никакой».
«Но ведь рыжих миллионы, – сказал я, – и каждый пожелает занять это вакантное место».
«Не так много, как вам кажется, – ответил он. – Объявление, как видите, обращено только к
лондонцам и притом лишь ко взрослым. Этот американец родился в Лондоне, прожил здесь свою
юность и хотел облагодетельствовать свой родной город. Кроме того, насколько я слышал, в Союз
рыжих не имеет смысла обращаться тем лицам, у которых волосы светло-рыжие или темно-рыжие, –
там требуются люди с волосами яркого, ослепительного, огненно-рыжего цвета. Если вы хотите воспользоваться этим предложением, мистер Уилсон, вам нужно только пройтись до конторы Союза
рыжих. Но имеет ли для вас смысл отвлекаться от вашего основного занятия ради нескольких сот
фунтов?..»
Как вы сами изволите видеть, джентльмены, у меня настоящие ярко-рыжие волосы огненнокрасного оттенка, и мне казалось, что, если дело дойдет до состязания рыжих, у меня, пожалуй, будет
шанс занять освободившуюся вакансию. Винсент Сполдинг, как человек весьма сведущий в этом деле, мог принести мне большую пользу, поэтому я распорядился закрыть ставни на весь день и велел
ему сопровождать меня в помещение Союза. Он очень обрадовался, что сегодня ему не придется работать, и мы, закрыв контору, отправилось по адресу, указанному в объявлении.
Я увидел зрелище, мистер Холмс, какого мне никогда больше не придется увидеть! С севера, с
юга, с востока и с запада все люди, в волосах которых был хоть малейший оттенок рыжего цвета,
устремились в Сити. Вся Флит-стрит была забита рыжими, а Попс-корт был похож на тачку разнос-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
чика, торгующего апельсинами. Никогда я не думал, что в Англии столько рыжих. Здесь были все
оттенки рыжего цвета: соломенный, лимонный, оранжевый, кирпичный, оттенок ирландских сеттеров, оттенок желчи, оттенок глины; но, как и указал Сполдинг, голов настоящего – живого, яркого,
огненного цвета тут было очень немного. Все же, увидев такую толпу, я пришел в отчаяние. Сполдинг не растерялся. Не знаю, как это ему удалось, но он проталкивался и протискивался с таким
усердием, что сумел провести меня сквозь толпу, и мы очутились на лестнице, ведущей в контору.
По лестнице двигался двойной людской поток: одни поднимались, полные приятных надежд, другие
спускались в унынии. Мы протискались вперед и скоро очутились в конторе…
– Замечательно интересная с вами случилась история! – сказал Холмс, когда его клиент замолчал, чтобы освежить свою память понюшкой табаку. – Пожалуйста, продолжайте.
– В конторе не было. ничего, кроме пары деревянных стульев и простого соснового стола, за
которым сидел маленький человечек, еще более рыжий, чем я. Он обменивался несколькими словами
с каждым из кандидатов; по мере того как они подходили к столу, и в каждом обнаруживал какойнибудь недостаток. Видимо, занять эту вакансию было не так-то просто. Однако, когда мы, в свою
очередь, подошли к столу, маленький человечек встретил меня гораздо приветливее, чем остальных
кандидатов, и, едва мы вошли, запер двери, чтобы побеседовать с нами без посторонних.
«Это мистер Джабез Уилсон, – сказал мой помощник. – Он хотел бы занять вакансию в Союзе».
«И он вполне достоин того, чтобы занять ее, – ответил человечек. – Давно не случалось мне видеть такие прекрасные волосы!»
Он отступил на шаг, склонил голову набок и глядел на мои волосы так долго, что мне стало неловко. Затем внезапно кинулся вперед, схватил мою руку и горячо поздравил меня.
He congratulated me warmly.
«Было бы несправедливостью с моей стороны медлить, – сказал он. – Однако, надеюсь, вы простите меня, если я приму некоторые меры предосторожности». Он вцепился в мои волосы обеими
руками и дернул так, что я взвыл от боли.
«У вас на глазах слезы, – сказал он, отпуская меня. – Значит, все в порядке. Извините, нам приходится быть осторожными, потому что нас дважды обманули с помощью париков и один раз – с помощью краски. Я мог бы рассказать вам о таких бесчестных проделках, которые внушили бы вам отвращение к людям».
Он подошел к окну и крикнул во все горло, что вакансия уже занята. Стон разочарования донесся снизу, толпа расползлась по разным направлениям, и скоро во всей этой местности не осталось
ни одного рыжего, кроме меня и того человека, который меня нанимал.
«Меня зовут мистер Дункан Росс, – сказал он, – и я тоже получаю пенсию из того фонда, который оставил нам наш великодушный благодетель. Вы женаты, мистер Уилсон? У вас есть семья?»
Я ответил, что я бездетный вдовец. На лице у него появилось выражение скорби.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Боже мой! – мрачно сказал он. – Да ведь это серьезнейшее препятствие! Как мне грустно, что
вы нс. женаты! Фонд был создан для размножения и распространения рыжих, а не только для поддержания их жизни. Какое несчастье, что вы оказались.холостяком!»
При этих словах мое лицо вытянулось, мистер Холмс, так как я стал опасаться, что меня не
возьмут; но, подумав, он заявил, что все обойдется:
«Ради всякого другого мы не стали бы отступать от правил, но человеку с такими волосами
можно пойти навстречу. Когда вы могли бы приступить к выполнению ваших новых обязанностей?»
«Это несколько затруднительно, так как я занят в другом деле», – сказал я.
«Не беспокойтесь об этом, мистер Уилсон! – сказал Винсент Сполдинг. – С той работой я
справлюсь и без вас».
«В какие часы я буду занят?» – спросил я.
«От десяти до двух».
Так как в ссудных кассах главная работа происходит по вечерам, мистер Холмс, особенно по
четвергам и по пятницам, накануне получки, я решил, что недурно будет заработать кое-что в утренние часы. Тем более, что помощник мой – человек надежный и вполне может меня заменить, если
нужно.
«Эти часы мне подходят, – сказал я. – А какое вы платите жалованье?»
«Четыре фунта в неделю».
«А в чем заключается работа?».
«Работа чисто номинальная».
«Что вы называете чисто номинальной работой?»
«Все. назначенное для работы время вам придется находиться в нашей конторе или, по крайней
мере, в здании, где помещается наша контора. Если вы хоть раз уйдете в рабочие часы, вы потеряете
службу навсегда. Завещатель особенно настаивает на точном выполнении этого пункта. Будет считаться, что вы не исполнили наших требований, если вы хоть раз покинете контору в часы работы».
«Если речь идет всего о четырех часах в сутки, мне, конечно, и в голову не придет покидать
контору», – сказал я.
«Это очень важно, – настаивал мистер Дункан Росс. – Потом мы никаких извинений и слушать
не станем. Никакие болезни, никакие дела не будут служить оправданием. Вы должны находиться в
конторе – или вы теряете службу».
«А в чем все-таки заключается работа?»
«Вам придется переписывать „Британскую энциклопедию“. Первый том – в этом шкафу. Чернила, перья, бумагу и промокашку вы достанете сами; мы же даем вам стол и стул. Можете ли вы
приступить к работе завтра?»
«Конечно», – ответил я.
«В таком случае, до свиданья, мистер Джабез Уилсон. Позвольте мне еще раз поздравить вас с
тем, что вам удалось получить такое хорошее место».
Он кивнул мне. Я вышел из комнаты и отправился домой вместе с помощником, радуясь своей
необыкновенной удаче. Весь день я размышлял об этом происшествии и к вечеру несколько упал духом, так как мне стало казаться, что все это дело – просто мошенничество, хотя мне никак не удавалось отгадать, в чем может заключаться цель подобной затеи. Казалось невероятным, что существует
такое завещание и что люди согласны платить такие большие деньги за переписку «Британской энциклопедии». Винсент Сполдинг изо всех сил старался подбодрить меня, но, ложась спать, я твердо
решил отказаться от этого дела. Однако утром мне пришло в голову, что следует хотя бы сходить туда на всякий случай. Купив на пенни чернил, захватив гусиное перо и семь больших листов бумаги, я
отправился в Попс-корт. К моему удивлению, там все было в порядке. Я очень обрадовался. Стол
был уже приготовлен для моей работы, и мистер Дункан Росс ждал меня. Он велел мне начать с буквы «А» и вышел; однако время от времени он возвращался в контору, чтобы посмотреть, работаю ли
я. В два часа он попрощался со мной, похвалил меня за то, что я успел так много переписать, и запер
за мной дверь конторы.
Так шло изо дня в день, мистер Холмс. В субботу мой хозяин выложил передо мной на стол четыре золотых соверена – плату за неделю. Так прошла и вторая неделя и третья. Каждое утро я приходил туда ровно к десяти и ровно в два уходил. Мало-помалу мистер Дункан Росс начал заходить в
контору только по утрам, а со временем и вовсе перестал туда наведываться. Тем не менее я, понятно, не осмеливался выйти из комнаты даже на минуту, так как не мог быть уверен, что он не придет,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
и не хотел рисковать такой выгодной службой.
Прошло восемь недель; я переписал статьи об Аббатах, об Артиллерии, об Архитектуре, об Аттике и надеялся в скором времени перейти к букве «Б». У меня ушло очень много бумаги, и написанное мною уже едва помещалось на полке. Но вдруг все разом кончилось.
– Кончилось?
– Да, сэр. Сегодня утром. Я пошел на работу, как всегда, к десяти часам, но дверь оказалась запертой на замок, а к двери был прибит гвоздиком клочок картона. Вот он, читайте сами.
Он протянул нам картон величиною с листок блокнота. На картоне было написано:
СОЮЗ РЫЖИХ РАСПУЩЕН 9 ОКТЯБРЯ 1890 ГОДА
Мы с Шерлоком Холмсом долго разглядывали и краткую эту записку и унылое лицо Джабеза
Уилсона; наконец смешная сторона происшествия заслонила от нас все остальное: не удержавшись,
мы захохотали.
The door was shut and locked.
– Не вижу здесь ничего смешного! – крикнул наш клиент, вскочив с кресла и покраснев до корней своих жгучих волос. – Если вы, вместо того чтобы помочь мне, собираетесь смеяться надо мной,
я обращусь за помощью к кому-нибудь другому!
– Нет, нет! – воскликнул Холмс, снова усаживая его в кресло. – С вашим делом я не расстанусь
ни за что на свете. Оно буквально освежает мне душу своей новизной. Но в нем, простите меня, все
же есть что-то забавное… Что же предприняли вы, найдя эту записку на дверях?
– Я был потрясен, сэр. Я не знал, что делать. Я обошел соседние конторы, но там никто ничего
не знал. Наконец, я отправился к хозяину дома, живущему в нижнем этаже, и спросил его, не может
ли он сказать мне, что случилось с Союзом рыжих. Он ответил, что никогда не слыхал о такой организации. Тогда я спросил его, кто такой мистер Дункан Росс. Он ответил, что это имя он слышит
впервые.
«Я говорю, – сказал я, – о джентльмене, который снимал у вас квартиру номер четыре».
«О рыжем?»
«Да».
«Его зовут Уильям Моррис. Он юрист, снимал у меня помещение временно – его постоянная
контора была в ремонте. Вчера выехал».
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Где его можно найти?»
«В его постоянной конторе. Он оставил свой адрес. Вот: Кинг-Эдуард-стрит, 17, близ собора
святого Павла».
Я отправился по этому адресу, мистер Холмс, но там оказалась протезная мастерская; в ней никто никогда не слыхал ни о мистере Уильяме Моррисе, ни о мистере Дункане Россе.
– Что же вы предприняли тогда? – спросил Холмс.
– Я вернулся домой на Сэкс-Кобург-сквер и посоветовался со своим помощником. Он ничем не
мог мне помочь. Он сказал, что следует подождать и что, вероятно, мне сообщат что-нибудь по почте. Но меня это не устраивает, мистер Холмс. Я не хочу уступать такое отличное место без боя, и, так
как я слыхал, что вы даете советы бедным людям, попавшим в трудное положение, я отправился
прямо к вам.
– И правильно поступили, – сказал Холмс. – Ваш случай – замечательный случай, и я счастлив,
что имею возможность заняться им. Выслушав вас, я прихожу к заключению, что дело это гораздо
серьезнее, чем может показаться с первого взгляда.
– Уж чего серьезнее! – сказал мистер Джабез Уилсон. – Я лишился четырех фунтов в неделю.
– Если говорить о вас лично, – сказал Холмс, – вряд ли вы можете жаловаться на этот необычайный Союз. Напротив, вы, насколько я понимаю, стали благодаря ему богаче фунтов на тридцать,
не говоря уже о том, что вы приобрели глубокие познания о предметах, начинающихся на букву «А».
Так что, в сущности, вы ничего не потеряли.
– Не спорю, все это так, сэр. Но мне хотелось бы разыскать их, узнать, кто они такие и чего ради они сыграли со мной эту шутку, если только это была шутка. Забава обошлась им довольно дорого: они заплатили за нее тридцать два фунта.
– Мы попытаемся все это выяснить. Но сначала разрешите мне задать вам несколько вопросов,
мистер Уилсон. Давно ли служит у вас этот помощник… тот, что показал вам объявление?
– К тому времени он служил у меня около месяца.
– Где вы нашли его?
– Он явился ко мне по моему объявлению в газете.
– Только он один откликнулся на ваше объявление?
– Нет, откликнулось человек десять.
– Почему вы выбрали именно его?
– Потому что он разбитной и дешевый.
– Вас прельстила возможность платить ему половинное жалованье?
– Да.
– Каков он из себя, этот Винсент Сполдинг?
– Маленький, коренастый, очень живой. Ни одного волоска на лице, хотя ему уже под тридцать.
На лбу у него белое пятнышко от ожога кислотой.
Холмс выпрямился. Он был очень взволнован.
– Я так и думал! – сказал он. – А вы не замечали у него в ушах дырочек для серег?
– Заметил, сэр. Он объяснил мне, что уши ему проколола какая-то цыганка, когда он был маленький.
– Гм! – произнес Холмс и откинулся на спинку кресла в глубоком раздумье. – Он до сих пор у
вас?
– О да, сэр, я только что видел его.
– Он хорошо справлялся с вашими делами, когда вас не было дома?
– Не могу пожаловаться, сэр. Впрочем, по утрам в моей ссудной кассе почти нечего делать.
– Довольно, мистер Уилсон. Через день или два я буду иметь удовольствие сообщить вам, что я
думаю об этом происшествии. Сегодня суббота… Надеюсь, в понедельник мы всё уже будем знать.
– Ну, Уотсон, – сказал Холмс, когда наш посетитель ушел, – что вы обо всем этом думаете?
– Ничего не думаю, – ответил я откровенно. – Дело это представляется мне совершенно таинственным.
– Общее правило таково, – сказал Холмс, – чем страннее случай, тем меньше в нем оказывается
таинственного. Как раз заурядные, бесцветные преступления разгадать труднее всего, подобно тому
как труднее всего разыскать в толпе человека с заурядными чертами лица. Но с этим случаем нужно
покончить как можно скорее.
– Что вы собираетесь делать? – спросил я.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Курить, – ответил он. – Эта задача как раз на три трубки, и я прошу вас минут десять не разговаривать со мной.
He curled himself up in his chair.
Он скрючился в кресле, подняв худые колени к ястребиному носу, и долго сидел в такой позе,
закрыв глаза и выставив вперед черную глиняную трубку, похожую на клюв какой-то странной птицы. Я пришел к заключению, что он заснул, и сам уже начал дремать, как вдруг он вскочил с видом
человека, принявшего твердое решение, и положил свою трубку на камин.
– Сарасате10 играет сегодня в Сент-Джемс-холле, – сказал он. – Что вы думаете об этом, Уотсон? Могут ваши пациенты обойтись без вас в течение нескольких часов?
– Сегодня я свободен. Моя практика отнимает у меня не слишком много времени.
– В таком случае, надевайте шляпу и идем. Раньше всего мне нужно в Сити. Где-нибудь по дороге закусим.
Мы доехали в метро до Олдерсгэйта, оттуда прошли пешком до Сэкс-Кобург-сквер, где совершились все те события, о которых нам рассказывали утром. Сэкс-Кобург-сквер – маленькая сонная
площадь с жалкими претензиями на аристократический стиль. Четыре ряда грязноватых двухэтажных кирпичных домов глядят окнами на крохотный садик, заросший сорной травой, среди которой
несколько блеклых лавровых кустов ведут тяжкую борьбу с. насыщенным копотью воздухом. Три
позолоченных шара и висящая на углу коричневая вывеска с надписью «Джабез Уилсон», выведенной белыми буквами, указывали, что здесь находится предприятие нашего рыжего клиента.
Шерлок Холмс остановился перед дверью, устремил на нее глаза, ярко блестевшие из-под полуприкрытых век. Затем он медленно прошелся по улице, потом возвратился к углу, внимательно
вглядываясь в дома. Перед ссудной кассой он раза три с силой стукнул тростью по мостовой, затем
подошел к двери и постучал. Дверь тотчас же распахнул расторопный, чисто выбритый молодой человек и попросил нас войти.
10 10Сарасате (1844-1908) – знаменитый испанский скрипач и композитор.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
The door was instantly opened.
– Благодарю вас, – сказал Холмс. – Я хотел только спросить, как пройти отсюда на Стрэнд.
– Третий поворот направо, четвертый налево, – мгновенно ответил помощник мистера Уилсона
и захлопнул дверь.
– Ловкий малый! – заметил Холмс, когда мы снова зашагали по улице. – Я считаю, что по ловкости он занимает четвертое место в Лондоне, а по храбрости, пожалуй, даже третье. Я о нем кое-что
знаю.
– Видимо, – сказал я, – помощник мистера Уилсона играет немалую роль в этом Союзе рыжих.
Уверен, вы спросили у него дорогу лишь затем, чтобы взглянуть на него.
– Не на него.
– На что же?
– На его колени.
– И что вы увидели?
– То, что ожидал увидеть.
– А зачем вы стучали по камням мостовой?
– Милейший доктор, сейчас время для наблюдений, а не для разговоров. Мы – разведчики в неприятельском лагере. Нам удалось кое-что узнать о Сэкс-Кобург-сквер. Теперь обследуем улицы, которые примыкают к ней с той стороны.
Разница между Сэкс-Кобург-сквер и тем, что мы увидели, когда свернули за угол, была столь
же велика, как разница между картиной и ее оборотной стороной. За углом проходила одна из главных артерий города, соединяющая Сити с севером и западом. Эта большая улица была вся забита
экипажами, движущимися двумя потоками вправо и влево, а на тротуарах чернели рои пешеходов.
Глядя на ряды прекрасных магазинов и роскошных контор, трудно было представить себе, что позади этих самых домов находится такая убогая, безлюдная площадь.
– Позвольте мне вдоволь насмотреться, – сказал Холмс, остановившись на углу и внимательно
разглядывая каждый дом один за другим. – Я хочу запомнить порядок зданий. Изучение Лондона –
моя страсть… Сначала табачный магазин Мортимера, затем газетная лавчонка, затем кобургское отделение Городского и Пригородного банка, затем вегетарианский ресторан, затем каретное депо
Макферлена. А там уже следующий квартал… Ну, доктор, наша работа окончена! Теперь мы можем
немного поразвлечься: бутерброд, чашка кофе и – в страну скрипок, где все сладость, нега и гармония, где нет рыжих клиентов, досаждающих нам головоломками.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
All afternoon he sat in the stalls.
Мой друг страстно увлекался музыкой; он был не только очень способный исполнитель, но и
незаурядный композитор. Весь вечер просидел он в кресле, вполне счастливый, слегка двигая длинными тонкими пальцами в такт музыке: его мягко улыбающееся лицо, его влажные, затуманенные
глаза ничем не напоминали о Холмсе-ищейке, о -безжалостном хитроумном Холмсе, преследователе
бандитов. Его удивительный характер слагался из двух начал. Мне часто приходило в голову, что его
потрясающая своей точностью проницательность родилась в борьбе с поэтической задумчивостью,
составлявшей основную черту этого человека. Он постоянно переходил от полнейшей расслабленности к необычайной энергии. Мне хорошо было известно, с каким бездумным спокойствием отдавался
он по вечерам своим импровизациям и нотам. Но внезапно охотничья страсть охватывала его, свойственная ему блистательная сила мышления возрастала до степени интуиции, и люди, незнакомые с
его методом, начинали думать, что перед ними не человек, а какое-то сверхъестественное существо.
Наблюдая за ним в Сент-Джемс-холле и видя, с какой полнотой душа его отдается музыке, я чувствовал, что тем, за кем он охотится, будет плохо.
– Вы, доктор, собираетесь, конечно, идти домой, – сказал он, когда концерт кончился.
– Домой, понятно.
– А мне предстоит еще одно дело, которое отнимет у меня три-четыре часа. Это происшествие
на Кобург-сквер – очень серьезная штука.
– Серьезная?
– Там готовится крупное преступление. У меня есть все основания думать, что мы еще успеем
предотвратить его. Но все усложняется из-за того, что сегодня суббота. Вечером мне может понадобиться ваша помощь.
– В котором часу?
– Часов в десять, не раньше.
– Ровно в десять я буду на Бейкер-стрит.
– Отлично. Имейте в виду, доктор, что дело будет опасное. Суньте в карман свой армейский револьвер.
Он помахал мне рукой, круто повернулся и мгновенно исчез в толпе.
Я не считаю себя глупее других, но всегда, когда я имею дело с Шерлоком Холмсом, меня угнетает тяжелое сознание собственной тупости. Ведь вот я слышал то же самое, что слышал он, я видел то же самое, что видел он, однако, судя по его словам, он знает и понимает не только то, что случилось, но и то, что случится, мне же все это дело по-прежнему представляется непонятной
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
нелепостью.
По дороге домой я снова припомнил и весь необычайный рассказ рыжего переписчика «Британской энциклопедии», и наше посещение Сэкс-Кобург-сквер, я те зловещие слова, которые Холмс
сказал мне при прощании. Что означает эта ночная экспедиция и для чего нужно, чтобы я пришел
вооруженным? Куда мы отправимся с ним и что предстоит нам делать? Холмс намекнул мне, что
безбородый помощник владельца ссудной кассы весьма опасный человек, способный на большие
преступления.
Я изо всех сил пытался разгадать эти загадки, но ничего у меня не вышло, и я решил ждать ночи, которая должна была разъяснить мне все.
В четверть десятого я вышел из дому и, пройдя по Гайд-парку, по Оксфорд-стрит, очутился на
Бейкер-стрит. У подъезда стояли два кэба, и, войдя в прихожую, я услышал шум голосов. Я застал у
Холмса двух человек. Холмс оживленно разговаривал с ними. Одного из них я знал – это был Питер
Джонс. официальный агент полиции; другой был длинный, тощий, угрюмый мужчина в сверкающем
цилиндре, в удручающе безукоризненном фраке.
– А, вот мы и в сборе! – сказал Холмс, застегивая матросскую куртку и беря с полки охотничий
хлыст с тяжелой рукоятью. – Уотсон, вы, кажется, знакомы с мистером Джонсом из Скотленд-Ярда?
Позвольте вас представить мистеру Мерриуэзеру. Мистер Мерриуэзер тоже примет участие в нашем
ночном приключении.
– Как видите, доктор, мы с мистером Холмсом снова охотимся вместе, – сказал Джонс с обычным своим важным и снисходительным видом. – Наш друг – бесценный человек. Но в самом начале
охоты ему нужна для преследования зверя помощь старого гончего пса.
– Боюсь, что мы подстрелим не зверя, а утку, – угрюмо сказал мистер Мерриуээер.
– Можете вполне положиться на мистера Холмса, сэр, – покровительственно проговорил агент
полиции. – У него свои собственные любимые методы, которые, позволю себе заметить, несколько
отвлеченны и фантастичны, но тем не менее дают отличные результаты. Нужно признать, что бывали
случаи, когда он оказывался прав, а официальная полиция ошибалась.
– Раз уж вы так говорите, мистер Джонс, значит, все в порядке, – снисходительно сказал незнакомец. – И все же, признаться, мне жаль, что сегодня не придется сыграть мою обычную партию в
роббер. Это первый субботний вечер за двадцать семь лет, который я проведу без карт.
– В сегодняшней игре ставка покрупнее, чем в ваших карточных играх, – сказал Шерлок
Холмс, – и самая игра увлекательнее. Ваша ставка, мистер Мерриуэзер, равна тридцати тысячам
фунтов стерлингов. А ваша ставка, Джонс, – человек, которого вы давно хотите поймать.
– Джон Клей – убийца, вор, взломщик и мошенник, – сказал Джонс. – Он еще молод, мистер
Мерриуэзер, но это искуснейший вор в стране: ни на кого другого я не надел бы наручников с такой
охотой, как на него. Он замечательный человек, этот Джон Клей. Его дед был герцог, сам он учился в
Итоне и в Оксфорде.
11 Мозг его так же изощрен, как его пальцы, и хотя мы на каждом шагу натыкаемся на его следы, он до сих пор остается неуловимым. На этой неделе он обворует кого-нибудь в
Шотландии, а на следующей он уже собирает деньги на постройку детского приюта в Коррнуэлле. Я
гоняюсь за ним уже несколько лет, а еще ни разу не видел его.
– Сегодня ночью я буду иметь удовольствие представить его вам. Мне тоже приходилось раза
два натыкаться на подвиги мистера Джона Клея, и я вполне согласен с вами, что он искуснейший вор
в стране… Уже одиннадцатый час, и нам пора двигаться в путь. Вы двое поезжайте в первом кэбе, а
мы с Уотсоном поедем во втором.
Шерлок Холмс во время нашей долгой поездки был не слишком общителен: он сидел откинувшись и насвистывал мелодии, которые слышал сегодня на концерте. Мы колесили по бесконечной
путанице освещенных газом улиц, пока наконец не добрались до Фаррингдон-стрит.
– Теперь мы совсем близко, – сказал мой приятель. – Мерриуэзер – директор банка и лично заинтересован во всем деле. Джонс тоже нам пригодится. Он славный малый, хотя ничего не смыслит в
своей профессии. Впрочем, у него есть одно несомненное достоинство: он отважен, как бульдог, и
цепок, как рак. Если уж схватит кого-нибудь своей клешней, так не выпустит… Мы приехали. Вот и
они.
Мы снова остановились на той же людной и оживленной улице, где были утром. Расплатив11 11В Итоне и Оксфорде находятся аристократические учебные заведения.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
шись с извозчиками и следуя за мистером Мерриуэзером, мы вошли в какой-то узкий коридор и
юркнули в боковую дверцу, которую он отпер для нас. За дверцей оказался другой коридор, очень
короткий. В конце коридора были массивные железные двери. Открыв эти двери, мы. спустились по
каменным ступеням винтовой лестницы и подошли к еще одним дверям, столь же внушительным.
Мистер Мерриуэзер остановился, чтобы зажечь фонарь, и повел нас по темному, пахнущему землей
коридору. Миновав еще одну дверь, мы очутились в обширном склепе или погребе, заставленном
корзинами и тяжелыми ящиками.
Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern.
– Сверху проникнуть сюда не так-то легко, – заметит Холмс, подняв фонарь и оглядев потолок.
– Снизу тоже, – сказал мистер Мерриуэзер, стукнув тростью по плитам, которыми был выложен пол. – Черт побери, звук такой, будто там пустота! – воскликнул он с изумлением.
– Я вынужден просить вас не шуметь, – сердито сказал Холмс. – Из-за вас вся наша экспедиция
может закончиться крахом. Будьте любезны, сядьте на один из этих ящиков и не мешайте.
Важный мистер Мерриуэзер с оскорбленным видом сел на корзину, а Холмс опустился на колени и с помощью фонаря и лупы принялся изучать щели между плитами. Через несколько секунд,
удовлетворенный результатами своего исследования, он поднялся и спрятал лупу в карман.
– У нас впереди по крайней мере час, – заметил он, – так как они вряд ли примутся за дело прежде, чем почтенный владелец ссудной кассы заснет. А когда он заснет, они не станут терять ни минуты, потому что чем раньше они окончат работу, тем больше времени у них останется для бегства…
Мы находимся, доктор, – как вы, без сомнения, уже догадались, – в подвалах отделения одного из
богатейших лондонских банков. Мистер Мерриуэзер – председатель правления банка; он объяснит
нам, что заставляет наиболее дерзких преступников именно в настоящее время с особым вниманием
относиться к этим подвалам.
– Мы храним здесь наше французское золото, – шепотом сказал директор. – Мы уже имели ряд
предупреждений, что будет совершена попытка похитить его.
– Ваше французское золото?
– Да. Несколько месяцев назад нам понадобились дополнительные средства, и мы заняли тридцать тысяч наполеондоров у банка Франции. Но нам даже не пришлось распаковывать эти деньги, и
они до сих пор лежат в наших подвалах. Корзина, на которой я сижу, содержит две тысячи наполеондоров, уложенных между листами свинцовой бумаги. Редко в одном отделении банка хранят столько
золота, сколько хранится у нас в настоящее время. Каким-то образом это стало известно многим, и
это заставляет директоров беспокоиться.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– У них есть все основания для беспокойства, – заметил Холмс. – Ну, нам пора приготовиться.
Я полагаю, что в течение ближайшего часа все будет кончено. Придется, мистер Мерриуэзер, закрыть этот фонарь чем-нибудь темным…
– И сидеть в темноте?
– Боюсь, что так. Я захватил колоду карт, чтобы вы могли сыграть свою партию в роббер, так
как нас здесь четверо. Но я вижу, что приготовления врага зашли очень далеко и что оставить здесь
свет было бы рискованно. Кроме того, нам нужно поменяться местами. Они смелые люди и, хотя мы
нападем на них внезапно, могут причинить нам немало вреда, если мы не будем осторожны. Я стану
за этой корзиной, а вы спрячьтесь за теми. Когда я направлю на грабителей свет, хватайте их. Если
они начнут стрельбу, Уотсон, стреляйте в них без колебания.
Я положил свой заряженный револьвер на крышку деревянного ящика, а сам притаился за ящиком. Холмс накрыл фонарь и оставил нас в полнейшей тьме. Запах нагретого металла напоминал нам,
что фонарь не погашен и что свет готов вспыхнуть в любое мгновение. Мои нервы, напряженные от
ожидания, были подавлены этой внезапной тьмой, этой холодной сыростью подземелья.
– Для бегства у них есть только один путь – обратно, через дом на Сэкс-Кобург-сквер, – прошептал Холмс. – Надеюсь, вы сделали то, о чем я просил вас, Джонс?
– Инспектор и два офицера ждут их у парадного входа.
– Значит, мы заткнули все дыры. Теперь нам остается только молчать и ждать.
Как медленно тянулось время! В сущности, прошел всего час с четвертью, но мне казалось, что
ночь уже кончилась и наверху рассветает. Ноги у меня устали и затекли, так как я боялся шевельнуться; нервы были натянуты. И вдруг внизу я заметил мерцание света.
Сначала это была слабая искра, мелькнувшая в просвете между плитами пола. Вскоре искра эта
превратилась в желтую полоску. Потом без всякого шума в полу возникло отверстие, и в самой середине освещенного пространства появилась рука – белая, женственная, – которая как будто пыталась
нащупать какой-то предмет. В течение минуты эта рука с движущимися пальцами торчала из пола.
Затем она исчезла так же внезапно, как возникла, и все опять погрузилось во тьму; лишь через узенькую щель между двумя плитами пробивался слабый свет.
«It's no use, John Clay»
Однако через мгновение одна из широких белых плит перевернулась с резким скрипом, и на ее
месте оказалась глубокая квадратная яма, из которой хлынул свет фонаря. Над ямой появилось гладко выбритое мальчишеское лицо; неизвестный зорко глянул во все стороны: две руки уперлись в
края отверстия; плечи поднялись из ямы, потом поднялось все туловище; колено уперлось в пол. Через секунду незнакомец уже во весь рост стоял на полу возле ямы и помогал влезть своему товарищу,
такому же маленькому и гибкому, с бледным лицом и с вихрами ярко-рыжих волос.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Все в порядке, – прошептал он. – Стамеска и мешки у тебя?.. Черт! Прыгай, Арчи, прыгай, а я
уж за себя постою.
Шерлок Холмс схватил его за шиворот. Второй вор юркнул в нору; Джонс пытался его задержать, но, видимо, безуспешно: я услышал треск рвущейся материи. Свет блеснул на стволе револьвера, но Холмс охотничьим хлыстом стегнул своего пленника по руке, и револьвер со звоном упал на
каменный пол.
– Бесполезно, Джон Клей, – сказал Холмс мягко. – Вы попались.
– Вижу, – ответил тот совершенно спокойно. – Но товарищу моему удалось ускользнуть, и вы
поймали только фалду его пиджака.
– Три человека поджидают его за дверями, – сказал Холмс.
– Ах вот как! Чисто сработано! Поздравляю вас.
– А я – вас. Ваша выдумка насчет рыжих вполне оригинальна и удачна.
– Сейчас вы увидите своего приятеля, – сказал Джонс. – Он шибче умеет нырять в норы, чем я.
А теперь я надену на вас наручники.
– Уберите свои грязные руки, пожалуйста! Не трогайте меня! – сказал ему наш пленник после
того, как наручники были надеты. – Может быть, вам неизвестно, что во мне течет королевская
кровь. Будьте же любезны, обращаясь ко мне, называть меня «сэр» и говорить мне «пожалуйста».
– Отлично, – сказал Джонс, усмехаясь. – Пожалуйста, сэр, поднимитесь наверх и соблаговолите
сесть в кэб, который отвезет вашу светлость в полицию.
– Вот так-то лучше, – спокойно сказал Джон Клей.
Величаво кивнув нам головой, он безмятежно удалился под охраной сыщика.
– Мистер Холмс, – сказал Мерриуэзер, выводи нас из кладовой, – я, право, не знаю, как наш
банк может отблагодарить вас за эту услугу. Вам удалось предотвратить крупнейшую кражу.
– У меня были свои собственные счеты с мистером Джоном Клеем, – сказал Холмс. – Расходы я
на сегодняшнем деле понес небольшие, и ваш банк безусловно возместит их мне, хотя, в сущности, я
уже вознагражден тем, что испытал единственное в своем роде приключение и услышал замечательную повесть о Союзе рыжих…
– Видите ли, Уотсон, – объяснил мне рано утром Шерлок Холмс, когда мы сидели с ним на
Бейкер-стрит за стаканом виски с содовой, – мне с самого начала было ясно, что единственной целью
этого фантастического объявления о Союзе рыжих и переписывания «Британской энциклопедии»
может быть только удаление из дома не слишком умного владельца ссудной кассы на несколько часов ежедневно. Способ, который они выбрали, конечно, курьезен, однако благодаря этому способу
они вполне добились своего. Весь этот план, без сомнения, был подсказан вдохновенному уму Клея
цветом волос его сообщника. Четыре фунта в неделю служили для Уилсона приманкой, а что значит
четыре фунта для них, если они рассчитывали получить тысячи! Они поместили в газете объявление;
один мошенник снял временно контору, другой мошенник уговорил своего хозяина сходить туда, и
оба вместе получили возможность каждое утро пользоваться его отсутствием. Чуть только я услышал, что помощник довольствуется половинным жалованьем, я понял, что для этого у него есть основательные причины.
– Но как вы отгадали их замысел?
– Предприятие нашего рыжего клиента – ничтожное, во всей его квартире нет ничего такого,
ради чего стоило бы затевать столь сложную игру. Следовательно, они имели в виду нечто находящееся вне его квартиры. Что это может быть? Я вспомнил о страсти помощника к фотографии, о том,
что он пользуется этой страстью, чтобы лазить зачем-то в погреб. Погреб! Вот другой конец запутанной нити. Я подробно расспросил Уилсона об этом таинственном помощнике и понял, что имею дело
с одним из самых хладнокровных и дерзких преступников Лондона. Он что-то делает в погребе, чтото сложное, так как ему приходится работать там по нескольку часов каждый день в течение двух месяцев. Что же он может там делать? Только одно: рыть подкоп, ведущий в какое-нибудь другое здание. Пойдя к такому выводу, я захватил вас и отправился познакомиться с тем местом, где все это
происходит. Вы были очень удивлены, когда я стукнул тростью по мостовой. А между тем я хотел
узнать, куда прокладывается подкоп – перед фасадом или на задворках. Оказалось, что перед фасадом его не было. Я позвонил. Как я и ожидал, мне открыл помощник. У нас уже бывали с ним коекакие стычки, но мы никогда не видали друг друга в лицо. Да и на этот раз я в лицо ему не посмотрел. Я хотел видеть его колени. Вы могли бы и сами заметить, как они у него были грязны, помяты,
протерты. Они свидетельствовали о многих часах, проведенных за рытьем подкопа. Оставалось толь-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ко выяснить, куда он вел свой подкоп. Я свернул за угол, увидел вывеску Городского и Пригородного банка и понял, что задача решена. Когда после концерта вы отправились домой, я поехал в Скотленд-Ярд, а оттуда к председателю правления банка.
– А как вы узнали, что они попытаются совершить ограбление именно этой ночью? – спросил я.
– Закрыв контору Союза рыжих, они тем самым давали понять, что больше не нуждаются в отсутствии мистера Джабеза Уилсона, – другими словами, их подкоп готов. Было ясно, что они постараются воспользоваться им поскорее, так как, во-первых, подкоп может быть обнаружен, а вовторых, золото может быть перевезено в другое место. Суббота им особенно удобна, потому что она
предоставляет им для бегства лишние сутки. На основании всех этих соображений я пришел к выводу, что попытка ограбления будет совершена, ближайшей ночью.
– Ваши рассуждения прекрасны! – воскликнул я в непритворном восторге. – Вы создали такую
длинную цепь, и каждое звено в ней безупречно.
Этот случай спас меня от угнетающей скуки, – проговорил Шерлок Холмс, зевая. – Увы, я чувствую, что скука снова начинает одолевать меня! Вся моя жизнь – сплошное усилие избегнуть тоскливого однообразия наших жизненных будней. Маленькие загадки, которые я порой разгадываю, помогают мне достигнуть этой цели.
– Вы истинный благодетель человечества, – сказал я.
Холмс пожал плечами:
– Пожалуй, я действительно приношу кое-какую пользу.

– Мой дорогой друг, жизнь несравненно причудливее, чем все, что способно создать воображение человеческое, – сказал Шерлок Холмс, когда мы с ним сидели у камина в его квартире на Бейкерстрит. – Нам и в голову не пришли бы многие вещи, которые в действительности представляют собою нечто совершенно банальное. Если бы мы с вами могли, взявшись за руки, вылететь из окна и,
витая над этим огромным городом, приподнять крыши и заглянуть внутрь домов, то по сравнению с
открывшимися нам необычайными совпадениями, замыслами, недоразумениями, непостижимыми
событиями, которые, прокладывая себе путь сквозь многие поколения, приводят к совершенно невероятным результатам, вся изящная словесность с ее условностями и заранее предрешенными развязками показалась бы нам плоской и тривиальной.
– И все же вы меня не убедили, – отвечал я. – Дела, о которых мы читаем в газетах, как правило, представлены в достаточно откровенном и грубом виде. Натурализм в полицейских отчетах доведен до крайних пределов, но это отнюдь не значит, что они хоть сколько-нибудь привлекательны или
художественны.
– Для того, чтобы добиться подлинно реалистического эффекта, необходим тщательный отбор,
известная сдержанность, – заметил Холмс. – А этого как раз и не хватает в полицейских отчетах, где
гораздо больше места отводится пошлым сентенциям мирового судьи, нежели подробностям, в которых для внимательного наблюдателя и содержится существо дела. Поверьте, нет ничего более неестественного, чем банальность.
Я улыбнулся и покачал головой.
– Понятно, почему вы так думаете. Разумеется, находясь в положении неофициального кон12 12«Человек – ничто, дело – все» (фр.)
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
сультанта и помощника вконец запутавшихся в своих делах обитателей трех континентов, вы постоянно имеете дело со всевозможными странными и фантастическими явлениями. Но давайте устроим
практическое испытание, посмотрим, например, что написано здесь, – сказал я, поднимая с полу утреннюю газету. – Возьмем первый попавшийся заголовок: «Жестокое обращение мужа с женой». Далее следует полстолбца текста, но я, и не читая, уверен, что все это хорошо знакомо. Здесь, без сомнения, фигурирует другая женщина, пьянство, колотушки, синяки, полная сочувствия сестра или
квартирная хозяйка. Даже бульварный писака не смог бы придумать ничего грубее.
– Боюсь, что ваш пример неудачен, как и вся ваша аргументация, – сказал Холмс, заглядывая в
газету. – Это – дело о разводе Дандеса, и случилось так, что я занимался выяснением некоторых мелких обстоятельств, связанных с ним. Муж был трезвенником, никакой другой женщины не было, а
жалоба заключалась в том, что он взял привычку после еды вынимать искусственную челюсть и
швырять ею в жену, что, согласитесь, едва ли придет в голову среднему новеллисту. Возьмите понюшку табаку, доктор, и признайтесь, что я положил вас на обе лопатки с вашим примером.
Он протянул мне старинную золотую табакерку с большим аметистом на крышке. Великолепие
этой вещицы настолько не вязалось с простыми и скромными привычками моего друга, что я не мог
удержаться от замечания по этому поводу.
– Да, я совсем забыл, что мы с вами уже несколько недель не виделись, – сказал он. – Это небольшой сувенир от короля Богемии в благодарность за мою помощь в деле с письмами Ирен Адлер.
– А кольцо? – спросил я, взглянув на великолепный бриллиант, блестевший у него на пальце.
– Подарок голландской королевской фамилии; но это дело настолько деликатное, что я не имею
права довериться даже вам, хотя вы любезно взяли на себя труд описать некоторые из моих скромных достижений.
– А сейчас у вас есть на руках какие-нибудь дела? – с интересом спросил я.
– Штук десять – двенадцать, но ни одного интересного. То есть все они по-своему важные, но
для меня интереса не представляют. Видите ли, я обнаружил, что именно незначительные дела дают
простор для наблюдений, для тонкого анализа причин и следствий, которые единственно и составляют всю прелесть расследования. Крупные преступления, как правило, очень просты, ибо мотивы
серьезных преступлений большею частью очевидны. А среди этих дел ничего интересного нет, если
не считать одной весьма запутанной истории, происшедшей в Марселе. Не исключено, однако, что не
пройдет и нескольких минут, как у меня будет дело позанятнее, ибо, мне кажется, я вижу одну из моих клиенток.
Говоря это, он встал с кресла и, подойдя к окну, смотрел на тихую, серую лондонскую улицу.
Взглянув через его плечо, я увидел на противоположной стороне крупную женщину в тяжелом меховом боа, с большим мохнатым красным пером на кокетливо сдвинутой набок широкополой шляпе.
Из-под этих пышных доспехов она нерешительно поглядывала на наши окна, то и дело порываясь
вперед и нервно теребя застежку перчатки.
Внезапно, как пловец, бросающийся в воду, она кинулась через улицу, и мы услышали резкий
звонок.
– Знакомые симптомы, – сказал Холмс, швыряя в камин окурок. – Нерешительность, у дверей
всегда свидетельствует о сердечных делах. Она хочет попросить совета, но боится: дело, очевидно,
слишком щекотливое. Но и здесь бывают разные оттенки. Если женщину глубоко оскорбили, она
уже не колеблется и, как правило, обрывает звонок. В данном случае тоже можно предположить любовную историю, однако эта девица не столько рассержена, сколько встревожена или огорчена. А вот
и она. Сейчас все наши сомнения будут разрешены.
В эту минуту в дверь постучали, и мальчик в форменной куртке с пуговицами доложил о прибытии мисс Мэри Сазерлэнд, между тем как сама эта дама возвышалась позади его маленькой черней
фигурки, словно торговый корабль в полной оснастке, идущий вслед за крохотным лоцманским ботом. Шерлок Холмс приветствовал гостью с присущей ему непринужденной учтивостью, затем закрыл дверь и, усадив ее в кресло, оглядел пристальным и вместе с тем характерным для него рассеянным взглядом.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Herlock Holmes welcomed her.
– Вы не находите, – сказал он, – что при вашей близорукости утомительно так много писать на
машинке?
– Вначале я уставала, но теперь печатаю слепым методом, – ответила она. Затем, вдруг вникнув
в смысл его слов, она вздрогнула и со страхом взглянула на Холмса. На ее широком добродушном
лице выразилось крайнее изумление.
– Вы меня знаете, мистер Холмс? – воскликнула она. – Иначе откуда вам все это известно?
– Неважно, – засмеялся Холмс. – Все знать – моя профессия. Быть может, я приучился видеть
то, чего другие не замечают. В противном случае, зачем вам было бы приходить ко мне за советом?
– Я пришла потому, что слышала о вас от миссис Этеридж, мужа которой вы так быстро отыскали, когда все, и даже полиция, считали его погибшим. О, мистер Холмс, если бы вы так же помогли и мне! Я не богата, но все же имею ренту в сто фунтов в год и, кроме того, зарабатываю перепиской на машинке, и я готова отдать все, только бы узнать, что сталось с мистером Госмером
Эйнджелом.
– Почему вы так торопились бежать ко мне за советом? – спросил Шерлок Холмс, сложив кончики пальцев и глядя в потолок.
На простоватой физиономии мисс Мэри Сазерлэнд снова появился испуг.
– Да, я действительно прямо-таки вылетела из дома, – сказала она. – Меня разозлило равнодушие, с каким мистер Уиндибенк, то есть мой отец, отнесся к этому делу. Он не хотел идти ни в полицию, ни к вам, ничего не желает делать, только знает твердить, что ничего страшного не случилось,
вот я и не вытерпела, кое-как оделась и прямо к вам.
– Ваш отец? – спросил Холмс. – Скорее, ваш отчим. Ведь у вас разные фамилии.
– Да, отчим. Я называю его отцом, хотя это смешно – он всего на пять лет и два месяца старше
меня.
– А ваша матушка жива?
– О да, мама жива и здорова. Не очень-то я была довольна, когда она вышла замуж, и так скоро
после смерти папы, причем он лет на пятнадцать ее моложе. У папы была паяльная мастерская на
Тоттенхем-Корт-роуд – прибыльное дельце, и мама продолжала вести его с помощью старшего мастера мистера Харди. Но мистер Уиндибенк заставил ее продать мастерскую: ему, видите ли, не к лицу, – он коммивояжер по продаже вин. Они получили четыре тысячи семьсот фунтов вместе с процентами, хотя отец, будь он в живых, выручил бы гораздо больше.
Я думал, что Шерлоку Холмсу надоест этот бессвязный рассказ, но он, напротив, слушал с величайшим вниманием.
– И ваш личный доход идет с этой суммы? – спросил он.
– О нет, сэр! У меня свое состояние, мне оставил наследство дядя Нэд из Окленда. Капитал в
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
новозеландских бумагах, четыре с половиной процента годовых. Всего две с половиною тысячи фунтов, но я могу получать только проценты.
– Все это очень интересно, – сказал Холмс. – Получая сто фунтов в год и прирабатывая сверх
того, вы, конечно, имеете возможность путешествовать и позволять себе другие развлечения. Я считаю, что на доход в шестьдесят фунтов одинокая дама может жить вполне безбедно.
– Я могла бы обойтись меньшим, мистер Холмс, но вы ведь сами понимаете, что я не хочу быть
обузой дома и, пока живу с ними, отдаю деньги в семью. Разумеется, это только временно. Мистер
Уиндибенк каждый квартал получает мои проценты и отдает их маме, а я отлично живу перепиской
на машинке. Два пенса за страницу, и частенько мне удается писать по пятнадцать – двадцать страниц в день.
– Вы очень ясно обрисовали мне все обстоятельства, – сказал Холмс. – Позвольте представить
вам моего друга, доктора Уотсона; при нем вы можете говорить откровенно, как наедине со мною. А
теперь, будьте любезны, расскажите подробно о ваших отношениях с мистером Госмером Эйнджелом.
Мисс Сазерлэнд покраснела и стала нервно теребить край своего жакета.
– Я познакомилась с ним на балу газопроводчиков. Папе всегда присылали билеты, а теперь
они вспомнили о нас и прислали билеты маме. Мистер Уиндибенк не хотел, чтобы мы шли на бал.
Он не хочет, чтобы мы где-нибудь бывали. А когда я завожу речь о каком-нибудь пикнике воскресной школы, он приходит в бешенство. Но на этот раз я решила пойти во что бы то ни стало, потому
что какое он имеет право не пускать меня? Незачем водить компанию с подобными людьми, говорит
он, а ведь там собираются все папины друзья. И еще он сказал, будто мне не в чем идти, когда у меня
есть совсем еще не надеванное красное бархатное платье. Больше возражать ему было нечего, и он
уехал во Францию по делам фирмы, а мы с мамой и мистером Харди, нашим бывшим мастером, пошли на бал. Там я и познакомилась с мистером Госмером Эйнджелом.
At the gasfitters' ball.
– Полагаю, что, вернувшись из Франции, мистер Уиндибенк был очень недоволен тем, что вы
пошли на бал? – спросил Холмс.
– Нет, он ничуть не рассердился. Он засмеялся, пожал плечами и сказал: что женщине ни запрети, она все равно сделает посвоему.
– Понимаю. Значит, на балу газопроводчиков вы и познакомились с джентльменом по имени
Госмер Эйнджел?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Да, сэр. Я познакомилась с ним в тот вечер, а на следующий день он пришел справиться, благополучно ли мы добрались до дому, и после этого мы, то есть я два раза была с ним на прогулке, а
затем вернулся отец, и мистер Госмер Эйнджел уже не мог нас навещать.
– Не мог? Почему?
– Видите ли, отец не любит гостей и вечно твердит, что женщина должна довольствоваться
своим семейным кругом. А я на это говорила маме: да, женщина должна иметь свой собственный
круг, но у меня-то его пока что нет!
– Ну, а мистер Госмер Эйнджел? Он не делал попыток с вами увидеться?
– Через неделю отец снова собирался во Францию, и Госмер написал мне, что до отъезда отца
нам лучше не встречаться. Он предложил мне пока переписываться и писал каждый день. Утром я
сама брала письма из ящика, и отец ничего не знал.
– К тому времени вы уже обручились с этим джентльменом?
– Да, мистер Холмс. Мы обручились сразу после первой же прогулки. Госмер… мистер Эйнджел… служит кассиром в конторе на Леднхолл-стрит и…
– В какой конторе?
– В том-то и беда, мистер Холмс, что я не знаю.
– А где он живет?
– Он сказал, что ночует в конторе.
– И вы не знаете его адреса?
– Нет, я знаю только, что контора на Леднхолл-стрит.
– Куда же вы адресовали ваши письма?
– В почтовое отделение Леднхолл-стрит, до востребования.
Он сказал, что на адрес конторы писать не надо, сослуживцы будут смеяться над ним, если узнают, что письма от дамы. Тогда я предложила писать свои письма на машинке, как он и сам делал, а
он не захотел. Сказал, что письма, написанные моей собственной рукой, дороги ему, а когда они напечатаны, ему кажется, что между нами что-то чужое. Видите, мистер Холмс, как он меня любил и
как был внимателен к мелочам.
– Это кое о чем говорит. Я всегда придерживался мнения, что мелочи существеннее всего, –
сказал Холмс. – Может быть, вы припомните еще какие-нибудь мелочи, касающиеся мистера Госмера Эйнджела?
– Он был очень застенчив, мистер Холмс. Он охотнее гулял со мною вечером, чем днем, не любил привлекать к себе внимание. Он был очень сдержан и учтив. Даже голос у него был тихий-тихий.
Он рассказывал, что в детстве часто болел ангиной и воспалением гланд и у него ослабли голосовые
связки, потому он и говорил шепотом. Он хорошо одевался, очень аккуратно, хотя и просто, а вот
глаза у него были слабые, как у меня, и поэтому он носил темные очки.
– Ну, а что произошло, когда ваш отчим, мистер Уиндибенк, опять уехал во Францию?
– Мистер Госмер Эйнджел пришел к нам и предложил мне обвенчаться, пока не вернулся отец.
Он был необычайно взволнован и заставил меня поклясться на Библии, что я всегда и во всем буду
ему верна. Мама сказала, что он правильно сделал, – это, мол, служит доказательством его любви.
Мама с самого начала очень хорошо к нему относилась, он ей нравился даже больше, чем мне. Потом
решили, что лучше отпраздновать свадьбу еще до конца недели. Я им говорю, как же без отца, а они
оба стали твердить, чтоб я об этом не думала, что отцу можно сообщить и после, а мама сказала, что
берется все уладить сама. Мне это не очень понравилось, мистер Холмс. Конечно, смешно просить
согласия отца, когда он всего на несколько лет старше меня; но я ничего не хотела делать тайком и
поэтому написала ему в Бордо – там французское отделение его фирмы, но письмо вернулось обратно в день моей свадьбы.
– Письмо его не застало?
– Да, сэр, он как раз перед тем выехал в Англию.
– Да, неудачно! Значит, свадьба была назначена на пятницу? Она должна была происходить в
церкви?
– Да, но очень скромно. Мы должны были обвенчаться в церкви Святого Спасителя возле
Кингс-кросс, а затем позавтракать в отеле Сент-Пэнкрес. Госмер приехал за нами в двуколке, но так
как нас было трое, он усадил нас с мамой, а сам взял кэб, который как раз оказался на улице. Мы
доехали до церкви первыми и стали ждать. Потом подъехал кэб, но он не выходил. Тогда кучер слез с
козел и заглянул внутрь, но там никого не оказалось! Кучер не мог понять, куда он делся, – он собст-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
венными глазами видел, как тот сел в кэб. Это случилось в пятницу, мистер Холмс, и с тех пор я так
и не знаю, что с ним произошло.
There was no one there!
– Мне кажется, он обошелся с вами самым бессовестным образом, – сказал Шерлок Холмс.
– О нет, сэр! Он добрый и хороший, он не мог меня бросить. Он все утро твердил, что я должна
быть ему верна, что бы ни случилось. Даже если случится что-нибудь непредвиденное, я должна всегда помнить, что дала ему слово и что рано, или поздно он вернется и я должна буду выполнить обещание. Как-то странно было слышать это перед самой свадьбой, но то, что случилось потом, придает
смысл его словам.
– Безусловно. Значит, вы полагаете, что с ним случилось какое-нибудь несчастье?
– Да, сэр, и я думаю, что он предчувствовал какую-то опасность, иначе он бы не говорил таких
странных вещей. И мне кажется, что его опасения оправдались.
– Но вы не знаете, что бы это могло быть?
– Нет.
– Еще один вопрос. Как отнеслась к этому ваша матушка?
– Она очень рассердилась, сказала, чтобы я и не заикалась об этой истории.
– А ваш отец? Вы рассказали ему, что случилось?
– Да. Он считает, что произошло какое-то несчастье, но что Госмер вернется. Какой смысл везти меня в церковь и скрыться, говорит он. Если бы он занял у меня деньги или женился и перевел на
свое имя мое состояние, тогда можно было бы объяснить его поведение, но Госмер очень щепетилен
насчет денег и ни разу не взял у меня ни шиллинга. Что могло случиться? Почему он не напишет? Я с
ума схожу, ночью не могу уснуть. – Она достала из муфты платок и горько заплакала.
– Я займусь вашим делом, – сказал Холмс, вставая, – и не сомневаюсь, что мы чего-нибудь
добьемся. Не думайте ни о чем, не волнуйтесь, а главное, постарайтесь забыть о Госмере Эйнджеле,
как будто его и не было.
– Значит, я никогда больше его не увижу?
– Боюсь, что так.
– Но что с ним случилось?
– Предоставьте это дело мне. Мне хотелось бы иметь точное описание его внешности, а также
все его письма.
– В субботу я поместила в газете «Кроникл» объявление о его пропаже, – сказала она. – Вот
вырезка и вот четыре его письма.
– Благодарю вас. Ваш адрес?
– Камберуэлл, Лайон-плейс, 31.
– Адреса мистера Эйнджела вы не знаете. Где служит ваш отец?
– Фирма «Вестхауз и Марбэнк» на Фенчерч-стрит – это крупнейшие импортеры кларета.
– Благодарю вас. Вы очень ясно изложили свое дело. Оставьте письма у меня и помните мой
совет. Забудьте об этом происшествии раз и навсегда.
– Благодарю вас, мистер Холмс, но это невозможно. Я останусь верна Госмеру. Я буду его
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ждать.
Несмотря на нелепую шляпу и простоватую физиономию, посетительница невольно внушала
уважение своим благородством и верностью. Она положила на стол бумаги и ушла, обещав прийти в
случае надобности.
He laid a little bundle upon the table.
Несколько минут Шерлок Холмс сидел молча, сложив кончики пальцев, вытянув ноги и устремив глаза в потолок. Затем он взял с полки старую глиняную трубку, которая всегда служила ему советчиком, раскурил ее и долго сидел, откинувшись на спинку кресла и утопая в густых облаках голубого дыма. На лице его изображалось полнейшее равнодушие.
– Занятное существо эта девица, – сказал он наконец. – Гораздо занятнее, чем ее история, кстати, достаточно избитая. Если вы заглянете в мою картотеку, вы найдете немало аналогичных случаев,
например, Андоверское дело 1877 года. Нечто подобное произошло и в Гааге в прошлом году. В общем, старая история, хотя в ней имеются некоторые новые детали. Однако сама девица дает богатейший материал для наблюдений.
– Вы, очевидно, усмотрели много такого, что для меня осталось невидимым, – заметил я.
– Не невидимым, а незамеченным, Уотсон. Вы не знали, на что обращать внимание, и упустили
все существенное. Я никак не могу внушить вам, какое значение может иметь рукав, ноготь на большом пальце или шнурок от ботинок. Интересно, что вы можете сказать на основании внешности этой
девицы? Опишите мне ее.
Ну, на ней была серо-голубая соломенная шляпа с большими полями и с кирпично-красным пером. Черный жакет с отделкой из черного стекляруса. Платье коричневое, скорее даже темнокофейного оттенка, с полоской алого бархата у шеи и на рукавах. Серые перчатки, протертые на указательном пальце правой руки. Ботинок я не разглядел. В ушах золотые сережки в виде маленьких
круглых подвесок. В общем, это девица вполне состоятельная, хотя и несколько вульгарная, добродушная и беспечная.
Шерлок Холмс тихонько захлопал в ладоши и усмехнулся.
– Превосходно, Уотсон, вы делаете успехи. Правда, вы упустили все существенные детали, зато
хорошо усвоили метод, и у вас тонкое чувство цвета. Никогда не полагайтесь на общее впечатление,
друг мой, сосредоточьте внимание на мелочах. Я всегда сначала смотрю на рукава женщины. Когда
имеешь дело с мужчиной, пожалуй, лучше начинать с колен брюк. Как вы заметили, у этой девицы
рукава были обшиты бархатом, а это материал, который легко протирается и поэтому хорошо сохра-

няет следы. Двойная линия немного выше запястья, в том месте, где машинистка касается рукою
стола, видна великолепно. Ручная швейная машина оставляет такой же след, но только на левой руке,
и притом на наружной стороне запястья, а у мисс Сазерлэнд след проходил через все запястье. Затем
я посмотрел на ее лицо и, увидев на переносице следы пенсне, сделал замечание насчет близорукости
и работы на пишущей машинке, что ее очень удивило.
– Меня это тоже удивило.
– Но это же совершенно очевидно! Я посмотрел на ее обувь и очень удивился, заметив, что на
ней разные ботинки; на одном носок был узорчатый, на другом – совсем гладкий. Далее, один ботинок был застегнут только на две нижние пуговицы из пяти, другой – на первую, третью и пятую пуговицу. Когда молодая девушка, в общем аккуратно одетая, выходит из дому в разных, застегнутых
не на все пуговицы ботинках, то не требуется особой проницательности, чтобы сказать, что она
очень спешила.
– А что вы еще заметили? – с интересом спросил я, как всегда восхищаясь проницательностью
моего друга.
– Я заметил, между прочим, что перед уходом из дому, уже совсем одетая, она что-то писала.
Вы обратили внимание, что правая перчатка у нее порвана на указательном пальце, но не разглядели,
что и перчатка и палец испачканы фиолетовыми чернилами. Она писала второпях и слишком глубоко
обмакнула перо. И это, по всей вероятности, было сегодня утром, иначе пятна не были бы так заметны. Все это очень любопытно, хотя довольно элементарно. Но вернемся к делу, Уотсон. Не прочтете
ли вы мне описание внешности мистера Госмера Эйнджела, данное в объявлении?
Я поднес газетную вырезку к свету и прочитал:
«Пропал без вести утром 14-го джентльмен по имени Госмер Эйнджел. Рост – пять
футов семь дюймов, крепкого сложения, смуглый, черноволосый, небольшая лысина на
макушке; густые черные бакенбарды и усы; темные очки, легкий дефект речи. Одет в
черный сюртук на шелковой подкладке, черный жилет, в кармане часы с золотой цепочкой, серые твидовые брюки, коричневые гетры поверх штиблет с резинками по бокам.
Служил в конторе на Леднхолл-стрит. Всякому, кто сообщит…»
– Этого достаточно. Что касается писем, – сказал Холмс, пробегая их глазами, – они очень банальны и ничего не дают для характеристики мистера Эйнджела, разве только, что он упоминает
Бальзака. Однако есть одно обстоятельство, которое вас, конечно, поразит.
– Они напечатаны на машинке, – заметил я.
– Главное, что и подпись тоже напечатана на машинке. Посмотрите на аккуратненькое «Госмер
Эйнджел» внизу. Есть дата, но нет адреса отправителя, кроме Леднхолл-стрит, а это весьма неопределенно. Но важна именно подпись, и ее мы можем считать доказательством.
– Доказательством чего?
– Милый друг, неужели вы не понимаете, какое значение имеет эта подпись?
– По правде говоря, нет. Может быть, он хотел оставить за собой возможность отрицать подлинность подписи в случае предъявления иска за нарушение обещания жениться.
Нет, суть не в том. Чтобы решить этот вопрос, я напишу два письма: одно – фирме в Сити, другое – отчиму молодой девушки, мистеру Уиндибенку, и попрошу его зайти к нам завтра в шесть часов вечера. Попробуем вести переговоры с мужской частью семейства. Пока мы не получим ответа
на эти письма, мы решительно ничего не можем предпринять и потому отложим это дело.
Зная о тонкой проницательности моего друга и о его необычайной энергии, я был уверен, что
раз он так спокойно относится к раскрытию этой странной тайны, значит, у него есть на то веские
основания. Мне был известен только один случай, когда он потерпел неудачу, – история с королем
Богемии и с фотографией Ирен Адлер. Однако я помнил о таинственном «Знаке четырех» и о необыкновенных обстоятельствах «Этюда в багровых тонах» и давно проникся убеждением, что, уж
если он не сможет распутать какую-нибудь загадку, стало быть, она совершенно неразрешима.
Холмс все еще курил свою черную глиняную трубку, когда я ушел, нисколько не сомневаясь,
что к моему возвращению на следующий вечер в его руках уже будут все нити дела об исчезновении
жениха мисс Мэри Сазерлэнд.
Назавтра я целый день провел у постели тяжело больного пациента. Только около шести часов
я наконец освободился, вскочил в двуколку и поехал на Бейкер-стрит, боясь, как бы не опоздать к
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
развязке этой маленькой драмы. Однако Холмса я застал дремлющим в кресле. Огромное количество
бутылок, пробирок и едкий запах соляной кислоты свидетельствовали о том, что он посвятил весь
день столь любезным его сердцу химическим опытам.
I found Herlock Holmes half asleep.
– Ну что, нашли, в чем дело? – спросил я, входя в комнату.
– Да, это был бисульфат бария.
– Нет, нет, я спрашиваю об этой таинственной истории.
– Ах, вот оно что! Я думал о соли, над которой работал. А в этой истории ничего таинственного
нет. Впрочем, я уже вчера говорил, что некоторые детали довольно любопытны. Жаль только, что
этого мерзавца нельзя привлечь к суду.
– Но кто же этот субъект, и зачем он покинул мисс Сазерлэнд?
Холмс раскрыл было рот, чтобы ответить, но в эту минуту в коридоре послышались тяжелые
шаги и в дверь постучали.
– Это отчим девицы, мистер Джеймс Уиндибенк, – сказал Холмс. – Он сообщил мне, что будет
в шесть часов. Войдите!
Вошел человек лет тридцати, среднего роста, плотный, бритый, смуглый, с вежливыми вкрадчивыми манерами и необычайно острым, проницательным взглядом серых глаз. Он вопросительно
посмотрел на Холмса, затем на меня, положил свой цилиндр на буфет и с легким поклоном уселся на
ближайший стул.
– Добрый вечер, мистер Джеймс Уиндибенк, – сказал Холмс.
– Полагаю, что это письмо на машинке, в котором вы обещаете прийти ко мне в шесть часов
вечера, написано вами?
– Да, сэр. Простите, я немного запоздал, но, видите ли, я не всегда располагаю своим временем.
Мне очень жаль, что мисс Сазерлэнд побеспокоила вас этим дельцем: по-моему, лучше не посвящать
посторонних в семейные неприятности. Я решительно возражал против ее намерения обратиться к
вам, но вы, наверное, заметили, какая она нервная и импульсивная, и уж если она что-нибудь задумала, переубедить ее нелегко. Разумеется, я ничего не имею против вас лично, поскольку вы не связаны
с государственной полицией; но все-таки неприятно, когда семейное горе становится общим достоянием. Кроме того, зачем понапрасну тратить деньги. Вы все равно не разыщете этого Госмера Эйнджела.
– Напротив, – спокойно возразил Холмс, – я имею все основания полагать, что мне удастся найти мистера Госмера Эйнджела.
Мистер Уиндибенк вздрогнул и уронил перчатку.
– Очень рад это слышать, – сказал он.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Обратили ли вы внимание, что любая пишущая машинка обладает индивидуальными чертами
в такой же мере, как почерк человека? – сказал Холмс. – Если исключить совершенно новые машинки, то не найти и двух, которые печатали бы абсолютно одинаково. Одни буквы изнашиваются сильнее других, некоторые буквы изнашиваются только с одной стороны. Заметьте, например, мистер
Уиндибенк, что в вашей записке буква «e» расплывчата, а у буквы «r» нет хвостика. Есть еще четырнадцать характерных примет, но эти просто бросаются в глаза.
– В нашей конторе на этой машинке пишутся все письма, и шрифт, без сомнения, немного стерся, – ответил наш посетитель, устремив на Холмса проницательный взгляд.
– А теперь, мистер Уиндибенк, я покажу вам нечто особенно интересное, – продолжал Холмc. –
Я собираюсь в ближайшее время написать небольшую работу на тему «Пишущие машинки и преступления». Этот вопрос интересует меня уже давно. Вот четыре письма, написанные пропавшим. Все
они отпечатаны на машинке. Посмотрите: в них все «e» расплываются и у всех «r» нет хвостиков, а
если воспользоваться моей лупой, можно также обнаружить и остальные четырнадцать признаков, о
которых я упоминал.
Мистер Уиндибенк вскочил со стула и взял свою шляпу.
– Я не могу тратить время на нелепую болтовню, мистер Холмc, – сказал он. – Если вы сможете
задержать этого человека, схватите его и известите меня.
– Разумеется, – сказал Холмc, подходя к двери и поворачивая ключ в замке. – В таком случае
извещаю вас, что я его задержал.
– Как! Где? – вскричал Уиндибенк, смертельно побледнев и озираясь, как крыса, попавшая в
крысоловку.
– Не стоит, право же, не стоит, – учтиво проговорил Холмс. – Вам теперь никак не отвертеться,
мистер Уиндибенк. Все это слишком ясно, и вы сделали мне прескверный комплимент, сказав, что я
не смогу решить такую простую задачу. Садитесь, и давайте потолкуем.
Glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
Наш посетитель упал на стул. Лицо его исказилось, на лбу выступил пот.
– Это… это – неподсудное дело, – пробормотал он.
– Боюсь, что вы правы, но, между нами говоря, Уиндибенк, с таким жестоким, эгоистичным и
бессердечным мошенничеством я еще не сталкивался. Я сейчас попробую рассказать, как развивались события, а если я в чем-нибудь ошибусь, вы меня поправите.
Уиндибенк сидел съежившись, низко опустив голову. Он был совершенно уничтожен. Холмс
положил ноги на решетку камина, откинулся назад и, заложив руки в карманы, начал рассказывать
скорее себе самому, чем нам:
– Человек женится на женщине много старше его самого, позарившись на ее деньги; он пользуется также доходом своей падчерицы, поскольку она живет с ними. Для людей их круга это весьма
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
солидная сумма, и потерять ее – ощутимый удар. Ради таких денег стоит потрудиться. Падчерица
мила, добродушна, но сердце ее жаждет любви, и совершенно очевидно, что при ее приятной наружности и порядочном доходе она недолго останется в девицах. Замужество ее, однако, означает потерю годового дохода в сто фунтов. Что же делает отчим, дабы это предотвратить? Он требует, чтобы
она сидела дома, запрещает ей встречаться с людьми ее возраста. Скоро он убеждается, что этих мер
недостаточно. Девица начинает упрямиться, настаивать на своих правах и, наконец, заявляет, что хочет посетить некий бал. Что же делает тогда ее изобретательный отчим? Он замышляет план, который делает больше чести его уму, нежели сердцу. С ведома своей жены и при ее содействии он изменяет свою внешность, скрывает за темными очками свои проницательные глаза, наклеивает усы и
пышные бакенбарды, приглушает свой звонкий голос до вкрадчивого шепота и, пользуясь близорукостью девицы, появляется в качестве мистера Госмера Эйнджела и отстраняет других поклонников
своим настойчивым ухаживанием.
– Это была шутка, – простонал наш посетитель. – Мы не думали, что она так увлечется.
– Возможно. Однако, как бы там ни было, молодая девушка искренне увлеклась. Она знала, что
отчим во Франции, и потому не могла ничего заподозрить. Она была польщена вниманием этого
джентльмена, а шумное одобрение со стороны матери еще более усилило ее чувство. Отлично понимая, что реального результата можно добиться только решительными действиями, мистер Эйнджел
зачастил в дом. Начались свидания, последовало обручение, которое должно было помешать молодой девушке отдать свое сердце другому. Но все время обманывать невозможно. Мнимые поездки во
Францию довольно обременительны. Оставался один выход: довести дело до такой драматической
развязку чтобы в душе молодой девушки остался неизгладимый след и она на какое-то время сделалась равнодушной к ухаживаниям других поклонников. Отсюда клятва верности на Библии, намеки
на возможность неожиданных происшествий в день свадьбы. Джеймс Уиндибенк хотел, чтобы мисс
Сазерлэнд была крепко связана с Госмером Эйнджелом и пребывала в полном неведении относительно его судьбы. Тогда, по его расчету, она по меньшей мере лет десять сторонилась бы мужчин.
Он довез ее до дверей церкви, но дальше идти не мог и потому прибегнул к старой уловке: вошел в
карету через одни дверцы, а вышел через другие. Я думаю, что события развертывались именно так,
мистер Уиндибенк?
Наш посетитель успел тем временем кое-как овладеть собой; он встал со стула. Холодная усмешка блуждала на его бледном лице.
– Может быть, так, а может быть, и нет, мистер Холмс, – сказал он. – Но если вы так умны, вам
следовало бы знать, что в настоящий момент закон нарушаете именно вы. Я ничего противозаконного не сделал, вы же, заперев меня в этой комнате, совершаете насилие над личностью, а это преследуется законом.
– Да, закон, как вы говорите, в вашем случае бессилен, – сказал Холмс, отпирая и распахивая
настежь дверь, – однако вы заслуживаете самого тяжкого наказания. Будь у этой молодой девушки
брат или друг, ему следовало бы хорошенько отстегать вас хлыстом. – Увидев наглую усмешку Уиндибенка, он вспыхнул.
– Это не входит в мои обязанности, но, клянусь Богом, я доставлю себе удовольствие. – Он
шагнул, чтобы снять со стены охотничий хлыст, но не успел протянуть руку, как на лестнице послышался дикий топот, тяжелая входная дверь с шумом захлопнулась, и мы увидели в окно, как мистер
Уиндибенк со всех ног мчится по улице.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He took two swift steps to the whip.
– Беспардонный мерзавец! – рассмеялся Холмс, откидываясь на спинку кресла. – Этот молодчик будет катиться от преступления к преступлению, пока не кончит на виселице. Да, дельце в некоторых отношениях была не лишено интереса.
– Я не вполне уловил ход ваших рассуждений, – заметил я.
– Разумеется, с самого начала было ясно, что этот мистер Госмер Эйнджел имел какую-то причину для своего странного поведения; так же очевидно, что единственно, кому это происшествие
могло быть на руку, – отчим. Тот факт, что жених и отчим никогда не встречались, а, напротив, один
всегда появлялся в отсутствие другого, также что-нибудь да значил. Темные очки, странный голос и
пышные бакенбарды подсказывали мысль о переодевании. Мои подозрения подтвердились тем, что
подпись на письмах была напечатана на машинке. Очевидно, мисс Сазерлэнд хорошо знала почерк
Уиндибенка. Как видите, все эти отдельные факты, а также и многие другие, менее значительные детали били в одну точку.
– А как вы их проверили?
– Напав на след, было уже нетрудно найти доказательства. Я знаю фирму, в которой служит
этот человек. Я взял описание внешности пропавшего, данное в объявлении, и, устранив из него все,
что могло быть отнесено за счет переодевания, – бакенбарды, очки, голос, – послал приметы фирме с
просьбой сообщить, кто из их коммивояжеров похож на этот портрет. Еще раньше я заметил особенности пишущей машинки и написал Уиндибенку по служебному адресу, приглашая его зайти сюда.
Как я и ожидал, ответ его был отпечатан на машинке, шрифт которой обнаруживал те же мелкие, но
характерные дефекты. Той же почтой я получил письмо от фирмы «Вестхауз и Марбэнк» на Фенчерч-стрит. Мне сообщили, что по всем приметам это должен быть их служащий Джеймс Уиндибенк. Вот и все!
– А как же быть с мисс Сазерлэнд?
– Если я раскрою ей секрет, она не поверит. Вспомните старую персидскую поговорку: «Опасно отнимать у тигрицы тигренка, а у женщины ее заблуждение".13 У Хафиза столько же мудрости,
как у Горация, и столько же знания жизни.

Тайна Боскомской долины
The Boscombe Valley Mystery
First published in the Strand Magazine, Oct. 1891,
with 10 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
Однажды утром, когда мы с женой завтракали, горничная подала мне телеграмму от Шерлока
Холмса:
«Не можете ли вы освободиться на два дня? Вызван на запад Англии связи трагедией Боскомской долине. Буду рад если присоединитесь ко мне. Воздух пейзаж великолепны. Выезжайте из Паддингтона в 11:15».
– Ты поедешь? – ласково взглянув на меня, спросила жена.
– Право, и сам не знаю. Сейчас у меня очень много пациентов…
– О, Анструзер всех их примет! Последнее время у тебя утомленный вид. Поездка пойдет тебе
на пользу. И ты всегда так интересуешься каждым делом, за которое берется мистер Шерлок Холмс.
Мой опыт лагерной жизни в Афганистане имел по крайней мере то преимущество, что я стал
закаленным и легким на подъем путешественником. Вещей у меня было немного, так что я сел со
своим саквояжем в кэб гораздо раньше, чем рассчитывал, и помчался на Паддингтонский вокзал.
Шерлок Холмс ходил вдоль платформы; его серый дорожный костюм и суконное кепи делали
его худую, высокую фигуру еще более худой и высокой.
– Вот чудесно, что вы пришли, Уотсон, – сказал он. – Совсем другое дело, когда рядом со мной
человек, на которого можно вполне положиться. Местная полиция или совсем бездействует, или идет
по ложному следу. Займите два угловых места, а я пойду за билетами.
Мы сели в купе. Холмс принялся читать газеты, которые он принес с собой; иногда он отрывался, чтобы записать что-то и обдумать.
We had carriage to ourselves.
Так мы доехали до Рэдинга. Неожиданно он смял все газеты в огромный ком и забросил его в
багажную сетку.
– Вы слышали что-нибудь об этом деле? – спросил он.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Ни слова. Я несколько дней не заглядывал в газеты.
– Лондонская печать не помещала особенно подробных отчетов. Я только что просмотрел все
последние газеты, чтобы вникнуть в подробности. Это, кажется, один из тех несложных случаев, которые всегда так трудны.
– Ваши слова звучат несколько парадоксально.
– Но это сама правда. В необычности почти всегда ключ к разгадке тайны. Чем проще преступление, тем труднее докопаться до истины… Как бы то ни было, в данном случае выдвинуто очень
серьезное обвинение против сына убитого.
– Значит, это убийство?
– Ну, так предполагают. Я ничего не берусь утверждать, пока сам не ознакомлюсь с делом. В
нескольких словах я объясню вам положение вещей, каким оно мне представляется…
Боскомская долина – это сельская местность вблизи Росса, в Хирфордшире. Самый крупный
землевладелец в тех краях – мистер Джон Тэнер. Он составил себе капитал в Австралии и несколько
лет назад вернулся на родину. Одну из своих ферм, Хазерлей, он сдал в аренду мистеру Чарлзу Маккарти, тоже приехавшему их Австралии. Они познакомились в колониях, и ничего странного не было
в том, что, переехав на новое место, они поселились как можно ближе друг к другу. Тэнер, правда,
был богаче, и Маккарти сделался его арендатором, но они, по-видимому, оставались в приятельских
отношениях. У Маккарти один сын, юноша восемнадцати лет, а у Тэнера – единственная дочь такого
же возраста, жены у обоих стариков умерли. Они, казалось, избегали знакомства с английскими семействами и вели уединенный образ жизни, хотя оба Маккарти любили спорт и часто посещали
скачки по соседству. Маккарти держали лакея и горничную. У Тэнера было большое хозяйство, по
крайней мере с полдюжины слуг. Вот и все, что мне удалось разузнать об этих семействах. Теперь о
самом происшествии.
Третьего июня, то есть в прошлый понедельник, Маккарти вышел из своего дома в Хазерлей
часа в три дня и направился к Боскомскому омуту. Это небольшое озеро, образованное разлившимся
ручьем, который протекает по Боскомской долине. Утром он ездил в Росс и сказал своему слуге, что
очень торопится, так как в три часа у него важное свидание. С этого свидания он не вернулся.
От фермы Хазерлей до Боскомского омута четверть мили, и, когда он шел туда, его видели два
человека. Во-первых, старуха, имя которой не упомянуто в газетах, и, во-вторых, Уильям Краудер,
лесник мистера Тэнера. Оба эти свидетеля показали, что мистер Маккарти шел один. Лесник добавил, что вскоре после встречи с мистером Маккарти он увидел его сына, – Джеймса Маккарти. Молодой человек шел с ружьем. Лесник утверждал, что он следовал за отцом по той же дороге. Лесник
совсем было позабыл об этой встрече, но вечером он услышал о происшедшей трагедии и все вспомнил.
Обоих Маккарти заметили еще раз после того, как Уильям Краудер, лесник, потерял их из виду.
Боскомский омут окружен густым лесом, все берега его заросли камышом. Дочь привратника Боскомского имения, Пэшенс Моран, девочка лет четырнадцати, собирала в. соседнем лесу цветы. Она
заявила, что видела, у самого озера мистера Маккарти и его сына. Было похоже, что, они сильно ссорятся. Она слышала, как старший Маккарти грубо кричал на сына, и видела, как последний замахнулся на своего отца, будто хотел ударить его. Она была так напугана этой ужасной сценой, что
стремглав бросилась домой и рассказала матери) что в лесу у омута отец и сын Маккарти затеяли
ссору и что она боится, как бы дело не дошло до драки. Едва она сказала это, как молодой Маккарти
вбежал в сторожку и сообщил, что он нашел в лесу своего отца мертвым, и позвал привратника на
помощь. Он был сильно возбужден, без ружья, без шляпы; на правой руке его и на рукаве были видны свежие пятна крови. Следуя за ним, привратник подошел к мертвецу, распростертому на траве у
самой воды. Череп покойного был размозжен ударами какого-то тяжелого, тупого оружия. Такие раны можно было нанести прикладом ружья, принадлежавшего сыну, которое валялось в траве в нескольких шагах от убитого. Под тяжестью этих улик молодой человек был сразу же арестован. Во
вторник следствие вынесло предварительный приговор: «преднамеренное убийство»; в среду
Джеймс Маккарти предстал перед мировым судьей Росса, который направил дело на рассмотрение
суда присяжных. Таковы основные факты, известные следователю и полиции.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
They found the body.
– Невозможно себе представить более гнусного дела, – заметил я. – Если когда-нибудь косвенные доказательства изобличали преступника, так это именно в данном случае.
– Косвенные доказательства очень обманчивы, – задумчиво проговорил Холмс – Они могут совершенно ясно указывать в одном направлении, но если вы способны разобраться в этих доказательствах, то можете обнаружить, что на самом деле они очень часто ведут нас не к истине, а в противоположную сторону. Правда, сейчас дело окончательно обернулось против молодого человека; не
исключена возможность, что он и есть преступник. Нашлись, однако, люди по соседству, и среди них
мисс Тэнер, дочь землевладельца, которые верят в его невиновность. Мисс Тэнер пригласила Лестрейда – может быть, вы его помните? – для защиты подсудимого. Лестрейд, считающий защиту
очень трудной, передал ее мне, и вот два джентльмена средних лет мчатся на запад со скоростью
пятьдесят миль в час, вместо того чтобы спокойно завтракать у себя дома.
– Боюсь, – сказал я, – факты слишком убедительны, и у вас будут очень ограниченные возможности выиграть этот процесс.
– Ничто так не обманчиво, как слишком очевидные факты, – ответил Холмс, смеясь. – Кроме
того, мы можем случайно наткнуться на какие-нибудь столь же очевидные факты, которые не оказались очевидными для мистера Лестрейда. Вы слишком хорошо меня знаете и не подумаете, что это
хвастовство. Я или пользуюсь уликами, собранными Лестрейдом, или начисто их отвергаю, потому
что сам он совершенно не в состоянии ни воспользоваться ими, ни даже разобраться в них. Взять хотя бы первый пришедший в голову пример: мне совершенно ясно, что в вашей спальне окно с правой
стороны, но я далеко не уверен, заметит ли мистер Лестрейд даже такой очевидный факт.
– Но как, в самом деле…
– Милый мой друг, я давно с вами знаком. Мне известна военная аккуратность, отличающая
вас. Вы бреетесь каждое утро и в это время года – при солнечном свете; но левая часть лица выбрита
у вас несравненно хуже правой, чем левее – тем хуже, доходя, наконец, до полного неряшества. Совершенно очевидно, что эта часть лица у вас хуже освещена, чем другая. Я не могу себе представить,
чтобы человек с вашими привычками смирился с плохо выбритой щекой, глядя в зеркало при нормальном освещении. Я привожу это только как простой пример наблюдательности и умения делать
выводы. В этом и заключается мое ремесло, и вполне возможно, что оно пригодится нам в предстоящем расследовании. Имеется одна или две незначительные детали, которые стали известны во время
допроса. Они заслуживают внимания.
– Что же это?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Оказывается, молодого Маккарти арестовали не сразу, а несколько позже, когда он уже вернулся на ферму Хазерлей. Полицейский инспектор заявил ему, что он арестован, а он ответил, что
это его ничуть не удивляет, так как он все-таки заслуживает наказания.
Его фраза произвела должный эффект – исчезли последние сомнения, которые, может быть,
еще имелись у следователя.
– Это было признание! – воскликнул я.
– Нет, затем он заявил о полной своей невиновности.
– После дьявольски веских улик это звучит подозрительно.
– Наоборот, – сказал Холмс, – это единственный проблеск, который я сейчас вижу среди туч.
Ведь он не может не знать, какие тяжелые подозрения падают на него. Если бы он притворился
удивленным или возмущенным при известии об аресте, это показалось бы мне в высшей степени подозрительным, потому что подобное удивление или негодование были бы совершенно неискренни
при сложившихся обстоятельствах. Такое поведение как раз свидетельствовало бы о его неискренности. Его бесхитростное поведение в минуту ареста говорит либо о его полной невиновности, либо,
наоборот, изобличает его незаурядное самообладание и выдержку. Что же касается его ответа, что он
заслуживает ареста, это тоже вполне естественно, если вспомнить, что он настолько забыл о своем
сыновнем долге, что нагрубил отцу и даже, как утверждает девочка – а ее показания очень важны, –
замахнулся на него. Его ответ, который говорит о раскаянии и об угрызениях совести, представляется
мне скорее признаком неиспорченности, чем доказательством преступных намерений.
Я покачал головой.
– Многих вздернули на виселицу и без таких тяжких улик, – заметил я.
– Это верно. И среди них было много невиновных.
– Каковы же объяснения самого молодого человека?
– Не особенно ободряющие для его защитников, хотя есть один или два положительных пункта.
Вы здесь это найдете, можете почитать про себя.
Он достал из своей папки несколько местных хартфордширских газет и, перегнув страницу,
указал на те строки, в которых несчастный молодой человек дает объяснения всему происшедшему.
Я уселся в углу купе и стал внимательно читать. Вот что там было написано:
«Затем был вызван мистер Джеймс Маккарти, единственный сын покойного. Он дал
следующие показания:
– В течение трех дней меня не было дома: я был в Бристоле и вернулся как раз утром в прошлый понедельник, третьего числа. Когда я приехал, отца не было дома, и горничная сказала, что он поехал в Росс с Джоном Коббом, конюхом. Вскоре после моего
приезда я услышал скрип колес его двуколки и, выглянув из окна, увидел, что он быстро
пошел со двора, но я не знал, в каком направлении он пойдет. Потом я взял свое ружье и
решил пройтись к Боскомскому омуту, чтобы осмотреть пустошь, где живут кролики;
пустошь расположена на противоположном берегу озера. По пути я встретил Уильяма
Краудера, лесничего, как он уже сообщил в своих показаниях; однако он ошибается, считая, что я догонял отца. Мне и в голову не приходило, что отец идет впереди меня. Когда
я был приблизительно в ста шагах от омута, я услышал крик «Koy!», которым я и мой
отец обычно звали друг друга. Я сразу побежал вперед и увидел, что он стоит у самого
омута. Он, по-видимому, очень удивился, заметив меня, и спросил довольно грубо, зачем
я здесь. Разговор дошел до очень резких выражений, чуть ли не до драки, потому что отец
мой был человек крайне вспыльчивый. Видя, что ярость его неукротима, я предпочел уйти от него и направился к ферме Хазерлей. Не прошел я и полутораста шагов, как услышал позади себя леденящий душу крик, который заставил меня снова бежать назад. Я
увидел распростертого на земле отца; на голове его зияли ужасные раны, в нем едва теплилась жизнь. Ружье выпало у меня из рук, я приподнял голову отца, но почти в то же
мгновение он умер. Несколько минут я стоял на коленях возле убитого, потом пошел к
привратнику мистера Тэнера попросить его помощи. Дом привратника был ближе других.
Вернувшись на крик отца, я никого не увидел возле него, и я не могу себе представить,
кто мог его убить. Его мало кто знал, потому что нрава он был несколько замкнутого и
неприветливого. Но все же, насколько мне известно, настоящих врагов у него не было.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
I held him in my arms.
Следователь. Сообщил ли вам что-нибудь перед смертью ваш отец?
Свидетель. Он пробормотал несколько слов, но я мог уловить только что-то похожее на «крыса».
Следователь. Что это, по-вашему, значит?
Свидетель. Не имею понятия. Наверное, он бредил.
Следователь. Что послужило поводом вашей последней ссоры?
Свидетель. Я предпочел бы умолчать об этом.
Следователь. К сожалению, я вынужден настаивать на ответе.
Свидетель. Но я не могу ответить на этот вопрос. Уверяю вас, что разговор наш не
имел никакого отношения к ужасной трагедии, которая последовала за ним.
Следователь. Это решит суд. Излишне объяснять вам, что нежелание отвечать послужит вам во вред, когда вы предстанете перед выездной сессией суда присяжных.
Свидетель. И все же я не стану отвечать.
Следователь. По-видимому, криком «Koy!» вы с отцом всегда подзывали друг друга?
Свидетель. Да.
Следователь. Как же могло случиться, что он подал условный знак до того, как вас
увидел, и даже до того, как он узнал, что вы вернулись из Бристоля?
Свидетель. (очень смущенный). Не знаю.
Присяжный заседатель. Не бросилось ли вам в глаза что-нибудь подозрительное,
когда вы прибежали на крик и нашли отца смертельно раненным?
Свидетель. Ничего особенного.
Следователь. Что вы хотите этим сказать?
Свидетель. Я был так взволнован и напуган, когда выбежал из лесу, что мог думать
только об отце, больше ни о чем. Все же у меня было смутное представление, что в тот
момент что-то лежало на земле слева от меня. Мне показалось: какая-то серая одежда –
может быть, плед. Когда я встал на ноги и хотел рассмотреть эту вещь, ее уже не было.
– Вы полагаете, что она исчезла прежде, чем вы пошли за помощью?
– Да, исчезла.
– Не можете ли вы сказать, что это было?
– Нет, у меня просто было ощущение, что там что-то лежит.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Далеко от убитого?
– Шагах в десяти.
– А на каком расстоянии от леса?
– Приблизительно на таком же.
– Значит, эта вещь находилась на расстоянии менее двадцати шагов от вас, когда
она исчезла?
– Да, но я повернулся к ней спиной.
Этим заканчивается допрос свидетеля».
– Мне ясно, – сказал я, взглянув на газетный столбец, – что в конце допроса следователь совершенно беспощаден к молодому Маккарти. Он указал, и не без основания, на противоречия в показании о том, что отец позвал сына, не зная о его присутствии, и также на отказ передать содержание
его разговора с отцом, затем на странное объяснение последних слов умирающего. Все это, как заметил следователь, сильно вредит сыну.
Холмс потянулся на удобном диване и с улыбкой сказал:
– Вы со следователем страдаете одним и тем же недостатком: отбрасываете все положительное,
что есть в показаниях молодого человека. Неужели вы не видите, что приписываете ему то слишком
много, то слишком мало воображения? Слишком мало – если он не мог придумать такой причины
ссоры, которая завоевала бы ему симпатии присяжных; и слишком много – если он мог дойти до такой выдумки, как упоминание умирающего о крысе и происшествие с исчезнувшей одеждой. Нет,
сэр, я буду придерживаться той точки зрения, что все, сказанное молодым человеком, – правда. Посмотрим, к чему приведет нас эта гипотеза. А теперь я займусь своим карманным Петраркой. Пока
мы не прибудем на место происшествия – об этом деле ни слова. Наш второй завтрак в Суиндоне. Я
думаю, мы приедем туда минут через двадцать.
Было около четырех часов, когда мы, миновав прелестную Страудскую долину и широкий
сверкающий Сэверн, очутились наконец в милом маленьком провинциальном городке Россе. Аккуратный, похожий на хорька человечек, очень сдержанный, с хитрыми глазками, ожидал нас на платформе. Хотя он был в коричневом пыльнике и в сапогах, которые он считал подходящими для сельской местности, я без труда узнал в нем Лестрейда из Скотленд-Ярда. С ним мы доехали до
«Хирфорд Армз», где нам были оставлены комнаты.
– Я заказал карету, – сказал Лестрейд за чашкой чая. – Мне известна ваша деятельная натура.
Ведь вы, до тех пор не можете успокоиться, пока не попадете на место преступления.
– Это очень похвально с вашей стороны, – ответил Холмс. – Но теперь все зависит от показаний барометра.
Лестрейд чрезвычайно удивился.
– Я не совсем понимаю вашу мысль, – сказал он.
– Каковы показания барометра? Двадцать девять ветра нет, на небе ни облачка – дождя не будет. А у меня целая пачка сигарет, которые надо выкурить. К тому же диван здесь несравненно лучше обычной мерзости деревенских гостиниц. Я думаю, что мне не удастся воспользоваться этой каретой сегодня вечером.
Лестрейд снисходительно засмеялся.
– Вы, конечно, уже пришли к какому-то заключению, прочитав газетные отчеты, – сказал он. –
Дело это ясное, как день, и чем глубже вникаешь в него, тем яснее оно становится. Но, конечно,
нельзя отказать в просьбе женщине, да еще такой очаровательной. Она слышала о вас и захотела
пригласить именно вас для защиты подсудимого, хотя я неоднократно говорил ей, что вы не сделаете
ничего, что бы не было уже давно сделано мной. О боже! У дверей ее экипаж!
Едва он сказал это, как в комнату вбежала одна из прелестнейших девушек, каких я когда-либо
видел. Голубые глаза сверкали, губы были слегка приоткрыты, нежный румянец заливал щеки.
Сильное волнение заставило ее забыть обычную сдержанность.
– О, мистер Шерлок Холмс! – воскликнула она, переводя взгляд с него на меня и наконец с безошибочной женской интуицией останавливаясь на моем друге. – Как я рада, что вы здесь! Я приехала
сказать вам это. Я уверена, что Джеймс невиновен. Приступая к вашей работе, вы должны знать то,
что известно мне. Не допускайте сомнений ни на одну минуту. Мы с ним дружили с раннего детства,
я лучше всех знаю все его слабости, но он так мягкосердечен, что не обидит и мухи. Всем, кто дейст-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
вительно знает его, такое обвинение представляется совершенно нелепым.
– Надеюсь, нам удастся оправдать его, мисс Тэнер, – сказал Шерлок Холмс. – Поверьте, я сделаю все, что в моих силах.
– Но вы читали отчеты, и у вас уже есть определенное мнение обо всем происшедшем? Не видите ли вы какого-нибудь просвета? Уверены ли вы сами, что он невиновен?
– Я считаю это вполне возможным.
– Вот, наконец! – воскликнула она, гордо поднимая голову и вызывающе глядя на Лестрейда. –
Вы слышали? Теперь у меня есть надежда.
Лестрейд пожал плечами.
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders.
– Боюсь, что мой коллега слишком поспешен в своих выводах, – сказал он.
– Но ведь он прав – о, я уверена, что он прав! Джеймс не способен на преступление. Что же касается его ссоры с отцом – я знаю: он потому ничего не сказал следователю, что в этом была замешана я.
– Каким образом? – спросил Холмс.
– Сейчас не время что-нибудь скрывать. У Джеймса были большие неприятности с отцом из-за
меня. Отец Джеймса очень хотел, чтобы мы поженились. Мы с Джеймсом всегда любили друг друга,
как брат и сестра, но он, конечно, еще слишком молод, не знает жизни и… и… ну, словом, он, естественно, и думать не хотел о женитьбе. На этой почве возникали ссоры, и, я уверена, это была одна
из таких ссор.
– А ваш отец? – спросил Холмс. – Хотел ли он вашего союза?
– Нет, он тоже был против. Кроме отца Джеймса, этого не хотел никто. – Сплошной румянец
залил ее свежее лицо, когда Холмс бросил на нее один из своих испытующих взглядов.
– Благодарю вас за эти сведения, – сказал он. – Могу ли я увидеться с вашим отцом, если зайду
завтра?
– Боюсь, доктор этого не позволит.
– Доктор?
– Да, разве вы не знаете? Последние годы мой бедный отец все время прихварывал, а это несчастье совсем сломило его. Он слег, и доктор Уиллоуз говорит, что у него сильное нервное потрясение
от перенесенного горя. Мистер Маккарти был единственным оставшимся в живых человеком, кто
знал папу в далекие времена в Виктории.
– Хм! В Виктории? Это очень важно.
– Да, на приисках.
– Совершенно верно, на золотых приисках, где, как я понимаю, мистер Тэнер и составил свой
капитал?
– Ну конечно.
– Благодарю вас, мисс Тэнер. Вы очень помогли мне.
– Сообщите, пожалуйста, если завтра у вас будут какие-нибудь новости. Вы, наверное, навести-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
те Джеймса в тюрьме? О, если вы увидите его, мистер Холмс, скажите ему, что я убеждена в его невиновности.
– Непременно скажу, мисс Тэнер.
– Я спешу домой, потому что папа серьезно болен. Я ему нужна. Прощайте, да поможет вам
бог!
Она вышла из комнаты так же поспешно, как и вошла, и мы услыхали стук колес удаляющегося
экипажа.
– Мне стыдно за вас, Холмс, – с достоинством сказал Лестрейд после минутного молчания. –
Зачем вы подаете надежды, которым не суждено оправдаться? Я не страдаю излишней чувствительностью, но считаю, что вы поступили жестоко.
– Кажется, я вижу путь к спасению Джеймса Маккарти, – сказал Холмс. – У вас есть ордер на
посещение тюрьмы?
– Да, но только для нас двоих.
– В таком случае, я изменяю свое решение не выходить из дома. Мы поспеем в Хирфорд, чтобы
увидеть заключенного сегодня вечером?
– Вполне.
– Тогда поедем! Уотсон, боюсь, вам будет скучно, но часа через два я вернусь.
Я проводил их до станции, прошелся по улицам городка, наконец вернулся в гостиницу, прилег
на кушетку и начал читать бульварный роман. Однако сюжет повествования был слишком плоским
по сравнению с ужасной трагедией, открывающейся перед нами. Я заметил, что мысли мои все время
возвращаются от книги к действительности, поэтому я швырнул книжку в другой конец комнаты и
погрузился в размышления о событиях истекшего дня. Если предположить, что показания этого несчастного молодого человека абсолютно правдивы, то что же за дьявольщина, что за непредвиденное
и невероятное бедствие могло произойти в тот промежуток времени, когда он отошел от своего отца,
а потом прибежал на его крики? Это было нечто ужасное, кошмарное. Что же это могло быть? Пожалуй, мне, как врачу, дело станет яснее, если я познакомлюсь с характером повреждений. Я позвонил
и потребовал последние номера местных газет, содержащие все материалы следствия слово в слово.
I tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
В показаниях хирурга устанавливалось, что третья задняя теменная кость и левая часть затылочной кости размозжены сильным ударом тупого орудия. Я нащупал это место на своей собственной голове. Несомненно, такой удар может быть нанесен только сзади. Это в некоторой степени снимало подозрение с обвиняемого, так как во время ссоры его видели стоящим лицом к лицу с
покойным. Но этому нельзя придавать большого значения, потому что отец мог отвернуться, перед
тем как его ударили. Однако нужно сообщить Холмсу и об этом. Затем очень странным представилось мне упоминание о крысе. Что это значит? Во всяком случае, не бред. Человек, умирающий от
внезапного удара, никогда не бредит. Нет, вероятно, он пытался объяснить, как он встретил свою
смерть. Что же он хотел сказать? Я долго пытался найти какое-нибудь подходящее объяснение.
Вспомнил и случай с этой серой одеждой, которую заметил молодой Маккарти. Если так было на самом деле, значит, убийца потерял что-то, когда убегал – наверно, пальто, – и у него хватило наглости
вернуться и взять его за спиной у сына, в двадцати шагах от него, когда тот опустился на колени возле убитого. Какое сплетение таинственного и невероятного в этом происшествии!
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Меня не удивило мнение Лестрейда, но я верил в дальновидность Холмса и не терял надежды:
мне казалось, что каждая новая деталь укрепляет его уверенность в невиновности молодого Маккарти.
Когда вернулся Холмс, было уже совсем поздно. Он был один, так как Лестрейд остановился в
городе.
– Барометр все еще не падает, – заметил он, садясь. – Только бы не было дождя, пока мы доберемся до места происшествия! Ведь человек должен вложить в такое славное дело все силы ума и
сердца. По правде сказать, я не хотел приниматься за работу, когда был утомлен длинной дорогой. Я
виделся с молодым Маккарти.
– Что же вы от него узнали?
– Ничего.
– Дело не стало яснее?
– Ничуть. Я был склонен думать, что ему известно имя преступника и что он скрывает его. Но
теперь я убежден – для него это такая же загадка, как и для всех остальных. Молодой Маккарти не
особенно умен, но очень миловиден, и мне показалось, что он человек неиспорченный.
– Я не одобряю его вкуса, – заметил я, – если это действительно правда, что он не хотел жениться на такой очаровательной молодой девушке, как мисс Тэнер.
– О, под всем этим кроется пренеприятная история! Он страстно, безумно любит ее. Но как вы
думаете, что он сделал года два назад, когда она была еще в пансионе, а сам он был совсем подростком? Этот идиот попался в лапы одной бристольской буфетчице и зарегистрировал свой брак с нею.
Об этом никто не подозревает, но можете себе представить, какое было для него мучение слушать
упреки, что он не делает того, за что он сам отдал бы полжизни! Вот это-то отчаяние и охватило его,
когда он простер руки к небу в ответ на требование отца сделать предложение мисс Тэнер. С другой
стороны, у него не было возможности защищаться, и отец его, который, как все утверждают, был человек крутого нрава, выгнал бы его из дому навеки, если бы узнал всю правду. Это со своей женойбуфетчицей юноша провел в Бристоле последние три дня, а его отец не знал, где он был. Запомните
это обстоятельство, это очень важно. Однако не было бы счастья – несчастье помогло. Буфетчица,
узнав из газет, что ее мужа обвиняют в тяжелом преступлении и, вероятно, скоро повесят, сразу же
его бросила и призналась ему в письме, что у нее уже давно есть другой законный муж, который живет в Бермудских доках, и что с мистером Джеймсом Маккарти ее на самом деле ничто не связывает.
Я думаю, это известие искупило все страдания молодого Маккарти.
– Но если он невиновен, кто же тогда убийца?
– Да, кто убийца? Я бы обратил ваше внимание на следующие два обстоятельства. Первое: покойный должен был с кем-то встретиться у омута, и этот человек не мог быть его сыном, потому что
сын уехал и не было известно, когда он вернется. Второе: отец кричал «Коу!» еще до того, как он узнал о возвращении сына. Это основные пункты, которые предрешают исход процесса… А теперь давайте поговорим о творчестве Джорджа Мередита,
14 если вам угодно, и оставим все второстепенные
дела до завтра.
Как и предсказывал Холмс, дождя не было; утро выдалось яркое и безоблачное. В девять часов
за нами в карете приехал Лестрейд, и мы отправились на ферму Хазерлейи к Боскомскому омуту.
– Серьезные известия, – сказал Лестрейд. – Говорят, что мистер Тэнер из Холла так плох, что
долго не Протянет.
– Вероятно, он очень стар? – спросил Холмс.
– Около шестидесяти, но он потерял в колониях здоровье и уже очень давно серьезно болеет.
Тут большую роль сыграло это дело. Он был старым другом Маккарти и, добавлю, его истинным
благодетелем. Как мне стало известно, он даже не брал с него арендной платы за ферму Хазерлей.
– Вот как! Это очень интересно! – воскликнул Холмс.
– О да. И он помогал ему всевозможными другими способами. Здесь все говорят о том, что
мистер Тэнер был очень добр к покойному.
– Да что вы! А вам не показалось несколько необычным, что этот Маккарти, человек очень небогатый, был так обязан мистеру Тэнеру и все же поговаривал о женитьбе своего сына на дочери
Тэнера, наследнице всего состояния? Да еще таким уверенным тоном, будто стоило только сделать
14 14Джордж Мередит (1828-1909) – известный английский писатель.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
предложение – и все будет в порядке! Это чрезвычайно странно. Ведь вам известно, что Тэнер и
слышать не хотел об их браке. Его дочь сама рассказала об этом. Не можете ли вы сделать из всего
сказанного какие-нибудь выводы методом дедукции?
– Мы занимались дедукцией и логическими выводами, – сказал Лестрейд, подмигивая мне. –
Знаете ли, Холмс, если в дальнейшем так же орудовать фактами, можно очень легко удалиться от истины в мир догадок и фантазий.
– Что правда, то правда, – сдержанно ответил Холмс. – Вы очень плохо пользуетесь фактами.
– Как бы то ни было, я подтвердил один факт, который оказался очень трудным для вашего понимания, – раздраженно возразил Лестрейд.
– То есть, что…
– Что Маккарти-старший встретил свою смерть от руки Маккарти-младшего и что все теории,
отрицающие этот факт, – просто лунные блики.
– Ну, лунные-то блики гораздо ярче тумана! – смеясь, ответил Холмс. – Если я не ошибаюсь,
слева от нас ферма Хазерлей.
– Она самая.
Это было широко раскинувшееся комфортабельное двухэтажное, крытое шифером здание с
большими желтыми пятнами лишайника на сером фасаде. Опущенные шторы на окнах и трубы, из
которых не шел дым, придавали дому угрюмый вид, будто кошмарное преступление всей своей тяжестью легло на эти стены.
Мы позвонили у двери, и горничная, по требованию Холмса, показала нам ботинки, в которых
был ее хозяин, когда его убили, и обувь сына, которую он надевал в тот день. Холмс тщательно измерил всю обувь в семи или восьми местах, затем попросил провести нас во двор, откуда мы пошли
по извилистой тропинке, ведущей к Боскомскому омуту.
The maid showed us the boots.
Шерлок Холмс весь преображался, когда шел по горячему следу. Люди, знающие бесстрастного мыслителя с Бейкер-стрит, ни за что не узнали бы его в этот момент. Он мрачнел, лицо его покрывалось румянцем, брови вытягивались в две жесткие черные линии, из-под них стальным блеском
сверкали глаза. Голова его опускалась, плечи сутулились, губы плотно сжимались, на мускулистой
шее вздувались вены. Его ноздри расширялись, как у охотника, захваченного азартом преследования.
Он настолько был поглощен стоящей перед ним задачей, что на вопросы, обращенные к нему, или
вовсе ничего не отвечал, или нетерпеливо огрызался в ответ.
Безмолвно и быстро шел он по тропинке, пролегавшей через лес и луга к Боскомскому омуту.
Это глухое, болотистое место, как и вся долина. На тропинке около нее, где растет низкая трава, было видно множество следов. Холмс то спешил, то останавливался, один раз круто повернул и сделал
по лужайке несколько шагов назад. Лестрейд и я следовали за ним, сыщик с видом безразличным и
пренебрежительным, в то время как я наблюдал за моим другом с большим интересом, потому что
был убежден, что каждое его действие ведет к благополучному завершению дела.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Боскомский омут – небольшое, шириной ярдов15 в пятьдесят, пространство воды, окруженное
зарослями камыша и расположенное на границе фермы Хазерлей и парка богача мистера Тэнера. Над
лесом, подступающим к дальнему берегу, видны красные остроконечные башенки, возвышающиеся
над жилищем богатого землевладельца.
Со стороны Хазерлей лес очень густой; только узкая полоска влажной травы шагов в двадцать
шириной отделяет последние деревья от камышей, окаймляющих озеро. Лестрейд точно указал, где
нашли тело; а земля действительно была такая сырая, что я мог ясно увидеть место, где упал убитый.
Что же касается Холмса, то по его энергичному лицу и напряженному взгляду я видел, что он многое
разглядел на затоптанной траве. Он метался, как гончая, напавшая на след, а потом обратился к нашему спутнику.
– Что вы здесь делали? – спросил он.
– Я прочесал граблями всю лужайку. Я искал какое-нибудь оружие или другие улики. Но как
вам удалось…
– Ну, хватит, у меня нет времени! Вы выворачиваете левую ногу, и следы этой вашей левой ноги видны повсюду. Вас мог бы выследить даже крот. А здесь, в камышах, следы исчезают. О, как было бы все просто, если бы я пришел сюда до того, как это стадо буйволов все здесь вытоптало! Здесь
стояли те, кто пришел из сторожки, они затоптали все следы вокруг убитого на шесть или семь футов.
16
Он достал лупу, лег на непромокаемый плащ, чтобы было лучше видно, и разговаривал более с
самим собой, чем с нами.
– Вот следы молодого Маккарти. Он проходил здесь дважды и один раз бежал так быстро, что
следы каблуков почти не видны, а остальная часть подошвы отпечаталась четко. Это подтверждает
его показания. Он побежал, когда увидел отца лежащим на земле. Далее, здесь следы ног отца, когда
он ходил взад и вперед. Что же это? След от приклада, на который опирался сын, когда стоял и слушал отца. А это? Ха-ха, то же это такое? Кто-то подкрадывался на цыпочках! К тому же это квадратные, совершенно необычные ботинки. Он пришел, ушел и снова вернулся – на этот раз, конечно, за
своим пальто. Но откуда он пришел?
Холмс бегал туда и сюда, иногда теряя след, иногда вновь натыкаясь на него, пока мы не очутились у самого леса, в тени очень большой, старой березы. Холмс нашел его следы за этим деревом
и снова лег на живот. Раздался радостный возглас. Холмс долго оставался неподвижным, переворачивал опавшие листья и сухие сучья, собрал в конверт что-то похожее на пыль и осмотрел сквозь лупу землю, а также, сколько мог достать, и кору дерева. Камень с неровными краями лежал среди мха;
он поднял и осмотрел его. Затем он пошел по тропинке до самой дороги, где следы терялись.
For a long time he remained there.
– Этот камень представляет большой интерес, – заметил он, возвращаясь к своему обычному
тону. – Серый дом справа – должно быть, сторожка. Я зайду к Морану, чтобы сказать ему два слова и
написать коротенькую записку. После этого мы еще успеем добраться до гостиницы, ко второму зав15 15Ярд – около 0,9 метра.
16 16Фут – около 0,3 метра.

траку. Вы идите к карете, я присоединюсь к вам.
Минут через десять мы уже ехали к Россу. В руках у Холмса все еще был камень, который он
поднял в лесу.
– Это может заинтересовать вас, Лестрейд, – сказал он, протягивая ему камень. – Вот чем было
совершено убийство.
– Я не вижу на нем никаких следов.
– Их нет.
– Тогда как же вы это узнали?
– Под ним росла трава. Он пролежал там всего лишь несколько дней. Нигде вокруг не было
видно места, откуда он взят. Это имеет прямое отношение к убийству. Следов какого-нибудь другого
оружия нет.
– А убийца?
– Это высокий человек, левша, он хромает на правую ногу, носит охотничьи сапоги на толстой
подошве и серое пальто, курит индийские сигары с мундштуком, в кармане у него тупой перочинный
нож. Есть еще несколько примет, но и этого достаточно, чтобы помочь нам в наших поисках.
Лестрейд засмеялся.
– К сожалению, я до сих пор остаюсь скептиком, – сказал он. – Ваши теории очень хороши, но
мы должны иметь дело с твердолобыми британскими присяжными.
– Ну, это мы увидим, – ответил спокойно Холмс. – У вас одни методы, у меня другие… Кстати,
я, может быть, сегодня с вечерним поездом вернусь в Лондон.
– И оставите ваше дело незаконченным?
– Нет, законченным.
– Но как же тайна?
– Она разгадана.
– Кто же преступник?
– Джентльмен, которого я описал.
– Но кто он?
– Это можно очень легко узнать. Здесь не так уж много жителей.
Лестрейд пожал плечами.
– Я человек действия, – сказал он, – и никак не могу заниматься поисками джентльмена, о котором известно только, что он хромоногий левша. Я бы стал посмешищем всего Скотленд-Ярда.
– Хорошо, – спокойно ответил Холмс. – Я предоставил вам все возможности для разгадки этой
тайны. Я ведь ничего не утаил от вас, и вы сами могли разгадать таинственное преступление. Вот мы
и приехали. Прощайте. Перед отъездом я вам напишу.
Оставив Лестрейда возле его двери, мы направились к нашему отелю, где нас уже ждал завтрак.
Холмс молчал, погруженный в свои мысли. Лицо его было мрачно, как у человека, который попал в затруднительное положение.
– Вот послушайте, Уотсон, – сказал он, когда убрали со стола. – Садитесь в это кресло, и я изложу перед вами то немногое, что мне известно. Я не знаю, что мне делать. Я бы хотел получить от
вас совет. Закуривайте, а я сейчас начну.
– Пожалуйста.
– Ну вот, при изучении этого дела нас поразили два пункта в рассказе молодого Маккарти, хотя
меня они настроили в его пользу, а вас восстановили против него. Во-первых, то, что отец закричал
«Коу» до того, как увидел своего сына. Во-вторых, что умирающий упомянул только о крысе. Понимаете, он пробормотал несколько слов, но сын уловил лишь одно. Наше расследование должно начаться с этих двух пунктов. Предположим, что все, сказанное юношей, – абсолютная правда.
– А что такое «коу»?
– Очевидно, он звал не своего сына. Он думал, что сын в Бристоле. Сын совершенно случайно
услышал этот зов. Этим Криком «Koy!» он звал того, кто назначил ему свидание. Но «коу» – австралийское слово, оно в ходу только между австралийцами. Это веское доказательство, что человек, которого Маккарти надеялся встретить у Боскомского омута, бывал в Австралии.
– Ну, а крыса?
Шерлок Холмс достал из кармана сложенный лист бумаги, расправил его на столе.
– Это карта штата Виктория, – сказал он. – Я телеграфировал прошлой ночью в Бристоль, чтобы мне ее прислали. – Он закрыл ладонью часть карты. – Прочтите, – попросил он.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Arat,
17
 – прочитал я.
– А теперь? – Он поднял руку.
– Ballarat.
– Совершенно верно. Это и есть слово, произнесенное умирающим, но сын уловил только последние два слога. Он пытался назвать имя убийцы. Итак, Балларэт.
– Это потрясающе! – воскликнул я.
– Это вне всяких сомнений. А теперь, как видите, круг сужается. Наличие у преступника серого
одеяния было третьим пунктом. Исчезает полная неизвестность, и появляется некий австралиец из
Балларэта в сером пальто.
– И в самом деле!
– К тому же он местный житель, потому что возле омута, кроме фермы и усадьбы, ничего нет, и
посторонний вряд ли забредет туда.
– Конечно.
– Затем наша сегодняшняя экспедиция. Исследуя почву, я обнаружил незначительные улики, о
которых и рассказал этому тупоумному Лестрейду. Это касалось становления личности преступника.
– Но как вы их обнаружили?
– Вам известен мой метод. Он базируется на сопоставлении всех незначительных улик.
– О его росте вы, разумеется, могли приблизительно судить по длине шага. О его обуви также
можно было догадаться по следам.
– Да, это была необыкновенная обувь.
– А то, что он хромой?
– Следы его правой ноги не так отчетливы, как следы левой. На правую ногу приходится меньше веса Почему? Потому что он прихрамывал – он хромой.
– А то, что он левша?
– Вы сами были поражены характером повреждений, описанных хирургом. Удар был внезапно
нанесен сзади, но с левой стороны. Кто же это мог сделать, как не левша? Во время разговора отца с
сыном он стоял за деревом. Он даже курил там. Я нашел пепел и благодаря моему знанию различных
сортов табака установил, что он курил индийскую сигару. Я, как вам известно, немного занимался
этим вопросом и написал небольшую монографию о пепле ста сорока различных сортов трубочного,
сигарного и папиросного табака. Обнаружив пепел сигары, я оглядел все вокруг и нашел место, куда
он ее бросил. То была индийская сигара, изготовленная в Роттердаме.

Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He had stood behind that tree.
– А мундштук?
– Я увидел, что он не брал ее в рот. Следовательно, он курит с мундштуком. Кончик был обрезан, а не откушен, но срез был неровный, поэтому грешил, что нож у него тупой.
– Холмс, – сказал я, – вы опутали преступника сетью, из которой он не сможет вырваться, и вы
спасли жизнь ни в чем не повинному юноше, вы просто сняли петлю с его шеи. Я вижу, где сходятся
все ваши улики. Имя убийцы…
– Мистер Джон Тэнер, – доложил официант, открывая дверь в нашу гостиную и впуская посетителя.
«Mr. John Turner», said the waiter.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
У вошедшего была странная, совершенно необычная фигура. Замедленная, прихрамывающая
походка и опущенные плечи делали его дряхлым, в то время как его жесткое, резко очерченное, грубое лицо и огромные конечности говорили о том, что он наделен необыкновенной физической силой.
Его спутанная борода, седеющие волосы и всклокоченные, нависшие над глазами брови придавали
ему гордый и властный вид. Но лицо его было пепельно-серым, а губы и ноздри имели синеватый
оттенок. Я с первого взгляда понял, что он страдает какой-то неизлечимой, хронической болезнью.
– Присядьте, пожалуйста, на диван, – мягко предложил Холмс. – Вы получили мою записку?
– Да, ее принес привратник. Вы пишете, что хотите видеть меня, дабы избежать скандала.
– Я думаю, будет много толков, если я выступлю в суде.
– Зачем я вам понадобился?
Тэнер посмотрел на моего приятеля. В усталых главах его было столько отчаяния, будто он уже
получил ответ на свой вопрос.
– Да, – промолвил Холмс, отвечая более на взгляд его, чем на слова. – Это так. Мне все известно о Маккарти.
Старик закрыл лицо руками.
– Помоги мне, господи! – воскликнул он. – Но я бы не допустил гибели молодого человека!
Даю вам слово, что я открыл бы всю правду, если бы дело дошло до выездной сессии суда присяжных…
– Рад это слышать, – сурово сказал Холмс.
– Я бы уже давно все открыл, если бы не моя дорогая девочка. Это разбило бы ее сердце, она не
пережила бы моего ареста.
– Можно и не доводить дело до ареста, – ответил Холмс.
– Неужели?
– Я неофициальное лицо. Поскольку меня пригласила ваша дочь, я действую в ее интересах. Вы
сами понимаете, что молодой Маккарти должен быть освобожден.
– Я скоро умру, – сказал старый Тэнер. – Я уже много лет страдаю диабетом. Мой доктор сомневается, протяну я месяц или нет. Все-таки мне легче будет умереть под своей собственной крышей, чем в тюрьме.
Холмс встал, подошел к письменному столу, взял перо и бумагу.
– Рассказывайте все, как было, – предложил он, – а я вкратце запишу. Вы это подпишете, а Уотсон засвидетельствует. Я представлю ваше признание только в случае крайней необходимости, если
нужно будет спасать Маккарти. В противном случае обещаю вам не прибегать к этой мере.
– Хорошо, – ответил старик. – Скорее всего я не доживу до выездной сессии суда, так что меня
это мало волнует. Я хотел бы только избавить Алису от такого удара. А теперь я все вам расскажу…
Тянулось это долго, но рассказать я могу очень быстро… Вы не знали покойного Маккарти. Это был
сущий дьявол, уверяю вас. Упаси вас бог от клещей такого человека! Я был в его тисках последние
двадцать лет, он совершенно отравил мне жизнь.
Сначала я расскажу вам, как я очутился в его власти. Это произошло в начале шестидесятых
годов на золотых приисках. Я тогда был совсем молодым человеком, безрассудным и горячим, готовым на любое дело. Я попал в плохую компанию, начал выпивать. На участке моем не оказалось ни
крупинки золота – я стал бродяжничать и сделался, как у вас говорится, рыцарем большой дороги.
Нас было шестеро, мы вели дикую, привольную жизнь, совершали время от времени налеты на станцию, останавливали фургоны на дорогах к приискам. Меня называли Балларэтским Черным Джеком.
Моих ребят до сих пор помнят в колониях как банду Балларэта.
Однажды из Балларэта в Мельбурн под охраной конвоя отправили золото. Мы устроили засаду.
Золото охраняли шесть конвоиров, нас тоже было шесть человек. Произошла жаркая схватка. Первым залпом мы уложили четырех. Но когда мы взяли добычу, нас осталось только трое. Я приставил
дуло пистолета к голове кучера – это и был Маккарти. Господи, лучше бы я убил его тогда! Но я пощадил его, хотя и заметил, что он смотрит на меня своими маленькими злыми глазками, будто хочет
запомнить черты моего лица. Мы завладели золотом, стали богатыми людьми и приехали в Англию,
никем не заподозренные. Здесь я навсегда расстался со своими бывшими приятелями и начал спокойную, обеспеченную жизнь.
Я купил это имение, которое как раз продавалось в то время, и старался принести хотя бы небольшую пользу своими деньгами, чтобы как-то искупить прошлое. К тому же я женился, и хотя же-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
на моя умерла молодой, она оставила мне милую маленькую Алису. Даже когда Алиса была совсем
крошкой, ее ручонки удерживали меня на праведном пути, как ничто в мире. Словом, я навсегда покончил с прошлым. Все шло великолепно, пока я не попался в руки Маккарти…
Я поехал в город по денежным делам и на Риджент-стрит встретил Маккарти. На нем не было
ни приличного пальто, ни обуви.
«Вот мы и встретились, Джек, – сказал он, прикасаясь к моей руке. – Теперь уж мы с вами
больше не расстанемся. Я не один: у меня есть сынишка, и вы должны о нас позаботиться. В противном случае, вы знаете: Англия прекрасная страна, где чтут законы. Кроме того, везде есть полисмены».
Вот он и поселился со своим сыном на западе, и я не мог от них отделаться; они бесплатно живут на моей земле. У меня не было ни покоя, ни отдыха, ни забвения. Куда бы я ни шел, я везде натыкался на его хитрую, ухмыляющуюся физиономию. Когда Алиса подросла, стало еще хуже, так
как он заметил, что для меня страшнее всякой полиции, если о моем прошлом узнает дочь. Что бы он
ни захотел, он получал по первому требованию, будь то земля, постройка или деньги, пока он не потребовал невозможного. Он потребовал Алису. Сын его, видите ли, подрос, моя дочь – тоже, и, так
как о моей болезни всем было известно, ему представилось, что это великолепный шанс для его сына
завладеть всем моим состоянием. Но на этот раз я был тверд. Я и мысли не мог допустить, что его
проклятый род соединится с моим.
Нельзя сказать, чтобы мне не нравился его сын, но в жилах юноши текла кровь его отца, этого
было достаточно. Я все же стоял на своем. Маккарти, выведенный из себя, стал угрожать.
Мы должны были встретиться у омута, на полпути между нашими домами, чтобы поговорить
обо всем. Когда я пришел на условленное место, я увидел, что он толкует о чем-то с сыном. Я закурил и ждал за деревом, пока он останется один. Но по мере того как я вслушивался в его слова, во
мне закипала горечь и злоба, я не мог больше этого вынести. Он принуждал сына жениться на моей
дочери, ничуть не заботясь о том, как она отнесется к этому, будто речь шла об уличной девчонке.
Я чуть с ума не сошел, когда подумал, что все, чем я дорожу, может очутиться во власти такого
человека. Не лучше ли разбить эти оковы? Я уже умирающий, доведенный до отчаяния человек. Хотя рассудок мой ясен и силы не покинули меня, я понимал, что моя жизнь кончена. Но мое имя и моя
дочь! Я спасу и то и другое, если заставлю Маккарти держать язык за зубами… Я его убил, мистер
Холмс… Я бы убил его снова. Я большой грешник, но разве жизнь, полная страданий, не искупает
вины? Я все терпел, но мысль, что моя дочь попадет в ту же западню, была невыносимы. Я убил его
без угрызения совести, будто это была отвратительная ядовитая тварь. На крик прибежал его сын, но
я успел спрятаться в, лесу, хотя мне пришлось вернуться за пальто, которое я обронил… Это чистая
правда, джентльмены, все служилось именно так.
– Что же, не мне судить вас, – промолвил Холмс, когда старик подписал свои показания. – Думаю, нам не придется представлять эти сведения в суд.
– Я вам полностью доверяю, сэр! Но что вы хотите предпринять?
– Принимая во внимание ваше здоровье – ничего. Вы сами знаете, что скоро предстанете перед
судом, который выше земного суда. Я сохраню ваше признание, мне придется воспользоваться им,
если Маккарти будет осужден. Если же он будет оправдан – ни один смертный, будете вы живы или
нет, не узнает о вашей тайне, все это останется между нами.
– Тогда прощайте, – торжественно сказал старик. – Когда настанет ваш смертный час, вам будет легче при мысли о том, какое успокоение вы внесли в мою душу.
Шатаясь и дрожа всем своим гигантским телом, он медленно вышел из комнаты, прихрамывая
на правую ногу.
– Бедные мы, бедные! – после долгой паузы воскликнул Холмс. – Почему судьба играет такими
жалкими, беспомощными созданиями, как мы?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Farewell, then», said the old man.
Выездная сессия суда присяжных оправдала Джеймса Маккарти под давлением многочисленных доказательств, представленных Холмсом. Старый Тэнер прожил месяцев семь после нашего
свидания, сейчас его уже нет в живых. Есть все основания полагать, что Джеймс и Алиса могут спокойно жить в счастливом браке, не думая больше о черных тучах, которые омрачали их прошлое.
Пять зернышек апельсина
The Five Orange Pips
First published in the Strand Magazine, Nov. 1891,
with 6 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
Когда я просматриваю мои заметки о Шерлоке Холмсе за годы от 1882 до 1890, я нахожу так
много удивительно интересных дел, что просто не знаю, какие выбрать. Однако одни из них уже известны публике из газет, а другие не дают возможности показать во всем блеске те своеобразные качества, которыми мой друг обладал в такой высокой степени. Все же одно из этих дел было так замечательно по своим подробностям и так неожиданно по результатам, что мне хотелось бы рассказать о
нем, хотя с ним связаны такие обстоятельства, которые, по всей вероятности, никогда не будут полностью выяснены.
1887 год принес длинный ряд более или менее интересных дел. Все они записаны мною. Среди
них – рассказ о «Парадол-чэмбер», Обществе Нищих-любителей, которое имело роскошный клуб в
подвальном этаже большого мебельного магазина; отчет о фактах, связанных с гибелью британского
судна «Софи Эндерсон»; рассказ о странных приключениях Грайса Петерсона на острове Юффа и,
наконец, записки, относящиеся к Кемберуэльскому делу об отравлении. В последнем деле Шерлоку
Холмсу удалось путем исследования механизма часов, найденных на убитом, доказать, что часы были заведены за два часа до смерти и поэтому покойный лег спать в пределах этого времени, – вывод,
который помог обнаружить преступника.
Все эти дела я, может быть, опишу когда-нибудь позже, но ни одно из них не обладает такими
своеобразными чертами, как те необычайные события, которые я намерен сейчас изложить.
Был конец сентября, и осенние бури свирепствовали с неслыханной яростью. Целый день завывал ветер, и дождь барабанил в окна так, что даже здесь, в самом сердце огромного Лондона, мы не-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
вольно отрывались на миг от привычного течения жизни и ощущали присутствие грозных сил разбушевавшейся стихии. К вечеру буря разыгралась сильнее; ветер в трубе плакат и всхлипывал, как
ребенок.
Шерлок Холмс был мрачен. Он расположился у камина и приводил в порядок свою картотеку
преступлений, а я, сидя против него, так углубился в чтение прелестных морских рассказов Кларка
Рассела, что завывание бури слилось в моем сознании с текстом, а шум дождя стал казаться мне рокотом морских волн.
Моя жена гостила у тетки, и я на несколько дней устроился в нашей старой квартире на Бейкерстрит.
– Послушайте, – сказал я, взглянув на Холмса, – это звонок. Кто же может прийти сегодня?
Кто-нибудь из ваших друзей?
– Кроме вас, у меня нет друзей, – ответил Холмс. – А гости ко мне не ходят.
– Может быть, клиент?
– Если так, то дело должно быть очень серьезное. Что другое заставит человека выйти на улицу
в такой день и в такой час? Но скорее всего это какая-нибудь кумушка, приятельница нашей квартирной хозяйки.
Однако Холмс ошибся, потому что послышались шаги в прихожей и стук в нашу дверь.
Холмс протянул свою длинную руку И повернул лампу от себя так, чтобы осветить пустое
кресло, предназначенное для посетителя.
– Войдите! – сказал он.
Вошел молодой человек лет двадцати двух, изящно одетый, с некоторой изысканностью в манерах. Зонт, с которого бежала вода, и блестевший от дождя длинный непромокаемый плащ свидетельствовали об ужасной погоде. Вошедший тревожно огляделся, и при свете лампы я увидел, что
лицо его бледно, а глаза полны беспокойства, как у человека, внезапно охваченного большой тревогой.
He looked about him anxiously.
– Я должен перед вами извиниться, – произнес он, поднося к глазам золотой лорнет. – Надеюсь,
вы не сочтете меня навязчивым… Боюсь, что я принес в вашу уютную комнату некоторые следы бури и дождя.
– Дайте мне ваш плащ и зонт, – сказал Холмс. – Они могут повисеть здесь, на крючке, и быстро
высохнут. Я вижу, вы приехали с юго-запада.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Да, из Хоршема.
– Смесь глины и мела на носках ваших ботинок очень характерна для этих мест.
– Я пришел к вам за советом.
– Его легко получить.
– И за помощью.
– А вот это не всегда так легко.
– Я слышал о вас, мистер Холмс. Я слышал от майора Прендергаста, как вы спасли его от скандала в клубе Тэнкервилл.
– А-а, помню. Он был ложно обвинен в нечистой карточной игре.
– Он сказал мне, что вы можете во всем разобраться.
– Он чересчур много мне приписывает.
– По его словам, вы никогда не знали поражений.
– Я потерпел поражение четыре раза. Три раза меня побеждали мужчины и один раз женщина.
– Но что это значит в сравнении с числом ваших успехов!
– Да, обычно у меня бывают удачи.
– В таком случае, вы добьетесь успеха и в моем деле.
– Прошу вас придвинуть ваше кресло к камину в сообщить мне подробности дела.
– Дело мое необыкновенное.
– Обыкновенные дела ко мне не попадают. Я высшая апелляционная инстанция.
– И все же, сэр, я сомневаюсь, чтобы вам приходилось за все время вашей деятельности слышать о таких непостижимых и таинственных происшествиях, как те, которые произошли в моей семье.
– Вы меня очень заинтересовали, – сказал Холмс. – Пожалуйста, сообщите нам для начала основные факты, а потом я расспрошу вас о тех деталях, которые покажутся мне наиболее существенными.
Молодой человек придвинул кресло и протянул мокрые ноги к пылающему камину.
– Меня зовут Джон Опеншоу, – сказал он. – Но, насколько я понимаю, мои личные дела мало
связаны с этими ужасными событиями. Это какое-то наследственное дело, и поэтому, чтобы дать вам
представление о фактах, я должен вернуться к самому началу всей истории…
У моего деда было два сына: мой дядя, Элиас, и мой отец, Джозеф. Мой отец владел небольшой
фабрикой в Ковентри. Ему удалось расширить ее, когда началось производство велосипедов. Отец
изобрел особо прочные шины «Опеншоу», и его предприятие пошло очень успешно, так что когда
отец в конце концов продал свою фирму, он удалился на покой вполне обеспеченным человеком.
Мой дядя Элиас в молодые годы эмигрировал в Америку и стал плантатором во Флориде, где,
как говорили, дела его шли очень хорошо. Во времена войны18 он сражался в армии Джексона, а затем под командованием Гуда и достиг чина полковника. Когда Ли сложил оружие,
19 мой дядя возвратился на свою плантацию, где прожил три или четыре года. В 1869 или 1870 году он вернулся в
Европу и арендовал небольшое поместье в Сассексе, вблизи Хоршема. В Соединенных Штатах он
нажил большой капитал и покинул Америку, так как питал отвращение к неграм и был недоволен
республиканским правительством, освободившим их от рабства.
Дядя был странный человек – жестокий и вспыльчивый. При всякой вспышке гнева он изрыгал
страшные ругательства. Жил он одиноко и чуждался людей. Сомневаюсь, чтобы в течение всех лет,
прожитых под Хоршемом, он хоть раз побывал в городе. У него был сад, лужайки вокруг дома, и там
он прогуливался, хотя часто неделями не покидал своей комнаты. Он много пил и много курил, но
избегал общения с людьми и не знался даже с собственным братом. А ко мне он, пожалуй, даже привязался, хотя впервые мы увиделись, когда мне было около двенадцати лет. Это произошло в 1878
году. К тому времени дядя уже восемь или девять лет прожил в Англии. Он уговорил моего отца,
чтобы я переселился к нему, и был ко мне по-своему очень добр. В трезвом виде он любил играть со
мной в кости и в шашки. Он доверил мне все дела с прислугой, с торговцами, так что к шестнадцати

Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
годам я стал полным хозяином в доме. У меня хранились все ключи, мне позволялось ходить куда
угодно и делать все что вздумается при одном условии: не нарушать уединения дяди. Но было все же
одно странное исключение: на чердаке находилась комната, постоянно запертая, куда дядя не разрешал заходить ни мне, ни кому-либо другому. Из мальчишеского любопытства я заглядывал в замочную скважину, но ни разу не увидел ничего, кроме старых сундуков и узлов.
Однажды – это было в марте 1883 года – на столе перед прибором дяди оказалось письмо с
иностранной маркой. Дядя почти никогда не получал писем, потому что покупки он всегда оплачивал наличными, а друзей у него не было.
«Из Индии, – сказал он, беря письмо. – Почтовая марка Пондишерри! Что это может быть?»
Дядя поспешно разорвал конверт; из него выпало пять сухих зернышек апельсина, которые выкатились на его тарелку. Я было рассмеялся, но улыбка застыла у меня на губах, когда я взглянул на
дядю. Его нижняя губа отвисла, глаза выкатились из орбит, лицо стало серым; он смотрел на конверт,
который продолжал держать в дрожащей руке.
«К.К.К.»! – воскликнул он. – Боже мой, боже мой! Вот расплата за мои грехи!»
«Что это, дядя?» – спросил я.
«Смерть», – сказал он, встал из-за стола и ушел в свою комнату, оставив меня в недоумении и
ужасе.
Я взял конверт и увидел, что на внутренней его стороне красными чернилами была три раза написана буква «К». В конверте не было ничего, кроме пяти сухих зернышек апельсина. Почему дядю
охватил такой ужас?
Я вышел из-за стола и взбежал по лестнице наверх. Навстречу мне спускался дядя. В одной руке у него был старый, заржавевший ключ, по-видимому, от чердачного помещения, а в другой – небольшая шкатулка из латуни.
«Пусть они делают что хотят, я все-таки им не сдамся! – проговорил он с проклятием. – Скажи
Мэри, чтобы затопила камин в моей комнате и пошла за Фордхэмом, хоршемским юристом».
Я сделал все, как он велел. Когда приехал юрист, меня позвали в комнату дяди. Пламя ярко пылало, а на решетке камина толстым слоем лежал пепел, по-видимому, от сожженной бумаги. Рядом
стояла открытая пустая шкатулка. Взглянув на нее, я невольно вздрогнул, так как заметил на внутренней стороне крышки тройное «К» – точно такое же, какое я сегодня утром видел на конверте.
«Я хочу, Джон, – сказал дядя, – чтобы ты был свидетелем при составлении завещания. Я оставляю свое поместье моему брату, твоему отцу, от которого оно, несомненно, перейдет к тебе. Если ты
сможешь мирно пользоваться им, тем лучше. Если же ты убедишься, что это невозможно, то последуй моему совету, мой мальчик, и отдай поместье своему злейшему врагу. Мне очень грустно, что
приходится оставлять тебе такое наследство, но я не знаю, какой оборот примут дела. Будь любезен,
подпиши бумагу в том месте, какое тебе укажет мистер Фордхэм».
Я подписал бумагу, как мне было указано, и юрист взял ее с собой.
Этот странный случай произвел на меня, как вы понимаете, очень глубокое впечатление, и я все
время думал о нем, не находи объяснений. Я не мог отделаться от смутного чувства страха, хотя оно
притуплялось по мере того, как шли недели и ничто не нарушало привычного течения жизни. Правда, я заметил перемену в моем дяде. Он пил больше прежнего и стал еще более нелюдимым. Большую часть времени он проводил, запершись в своей комнате. Но иногда в каком-то пьяном бреду он
выбегал из дому, слонялся по саду с револьвером в руке и кричал, что никого не боится, и не даст ни
человеку, ни дьяволу зарезать себя, как овцу. Однако когда эти горячечные припадки проходили, он
сразу бежал домой и запирался в комнате на ключ и на засовы, как человек, охваченный непреодолимым страхом. Во время таких припадков его лицо даже в холодные дни блестело от пота, как будто он только что вышел из бани.
Чтобы покончить с этим, мистер Холмс, и не злоупотреблять вашим терпением, скажу только,
что однажды настала ночь, когда он совершил одну из своих пьяных вылазок, после которой уже не
вернулся. Мы отправились на розыски. Он лежал ничком в маленьком, заросшем тиной пруду, расположенном в глубине нашего сада. На теле не было никаких признаков насилия, а воды в пруду было не больше двух футов. Поэтому суд присяжных, принимая во внимание чудачества дяди, признал
причиной смерти самоубийство. Но я, знавший, как его пугала самая мысль о смерти, не мог убедить
себя, что он добровольно расстался с жизнью. Как бы то ни было, дело на этом и кончилось, и мой
отец вступил во владение поместьем и четырнадцатью тысячами фунтов, которые лежат на его текущем счете в банке…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
We found him face downward in a little green-scummed pool.
– Позвольте, – прервал его Холмс. – Ваше сообщение, как я вижу, одно из самых интересных,
какие я когда-либо слышал. Укажите мне дату получения вашим дядей письма и дату его предполагаемого самоубийства.
– Письмо пришло десятого марта 1883 года. Он погиб через семь недель, в ночь на второе мая.
– Благодарю вас. Пожалуйста, продолжайте.
– Когда отец вступил во владения хоршемской усадьбой, он по моему настоянию произвел
тщательный осмотр чердачного помещения, которое всегда было заперто. Мы нашли там латунную
шкатулку. Все ее содержимое было уничтожено. Ко внутренней стороне крышки была приклеена
бумажная этикетка с тремя буквами «К» и подписью внизу; «Письма, записи, расписки и реестр».
Как мы полагаем, эти слова указывали на характер бумаг, уничтоженных полковником Опеншоу.
Кроме этого, на чердаке не было ничего существенного, если не считать огромного количества разбросанных бумаг и записных книжек, касавшихся жизни дяди в Америке. Некоторые из них относились ко времени войны и свидетельствовали о том, что дядя хорошо выполнял свой долг и заслужил
репутацию храброго солдата. Другие бумаги относились к эпохе преобразования Южных штатов и
по большей части касались политических вопросов, так как дядя, очевидно, играл большую роль в
оппозиции.
Так вот, в начале 84 года отец поселился в Хоршеме, и все шло у нас как нельзя лучше до 85
года. Четвертого января, когда мы все сидели за завтраком, отец внезапно вскрикнул от изумления. В
одной руке он держал только что вскрытый конверт, а на протянутой ладони другой руки – пять сухих зернышек апельсина. Он всегда смеялся над тем, что он называл «небылицами насчет полковника», а теперь и сам испугался, когда получил такое же послание.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«What on earth does this mean?»
«Что бы это могло значить, Джон?» – пробормотал он.
Мое сердце окаменело.
«Это К.К.К.», – ответил я.
Отец заглянул внутрь конверта.
«Да, здесь те же буквы. Но что это написано под ними?»
«Положите бумаги на солнечные часы», – прочитал я, взглянув ему через плечо.
«Какие бумаги? Какие солнечные часы?» – спросил он.
«Солнечные часы в саду, других здесь нет. Но бумаги, должно быть, те, которые уничтожены».
«Черт возьми! – сказал он. – Мы живем в цивилизованной стране и не можем принимать всерьез такую чушь. Откуда это письмо?»
«Из Данди», – ответил я, взглянув на почтовый штемпель.
«Чья-нибудь нелепая шутка, – сказал он. – Какое мне дело до солнечных часов и бумаг? Нечего
и обращать внимания на этакий вздор!»
«Я бы сообщил полиции», – сказал я.
«Чтобы меня высмеяли? И не подумаю».
«Тогда позвольте мне это сделать».
«Ни в коем случае. Я не хочу поднимать шум из-за таких пустяков».
Уговаривать отца было бы напрасным трудом, потому что он был очень упрям. А меня охватили тяжелые предчувствия.
На третий день после получения письма отец поехал навестить своего старого друга, майора
Фрибоди, который командует одним из фортов Портсдаун-Хилла. Я был рад, что он уехал, так как
мне казалось, что вне дома он дальше от опасности. Однако я ошибся. На второй день после его отъезда я получил от майора телеграмму, в которой он умолял меня немедленно приехать. Отец упал в
один из глубоких меловых карьеров, которыми изобилует местность, и лежал без чувств, с раздробленным черепом. Я поспешил к нему, но он умер, не приходя в сознание. По-видимому, он возвращался из Фэрхема в сумерки. А так как местность ему незнакома и меловые шахты не огорожены,
суд присяжных, не колеблясь, вынес решение: «Смерть от несчастного случая».
Я тщательно изучил все факты, связанные с его смертью, но не мог обнаружить ничего, что наводило бы на мысль об убийстве. Не было признаков насилия, не было никаких следов на земле, не
было ограбления, не было посторонних лиц на дорогах. И все же излишне говорить вам, что я не находил покоя и был почти уверен, что отец мой попал в расставленные кем-то сети.
При таких трагических обстоятельствах я вступил в права наследства. Вы спросите меня, почему я не отказался от него? Отвечу вам: я был убежден, что наши несчастья каким-то образом связаны
с давними событиями в жизни моего дяди и что опасность будет мне угрожать одинаково в любом
доме.
Мой бедный отец скончался в январе 85 года; с тех пор прошло два года и восемь месяцев. Все
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
это время я мирно прожил в Хоршеме и начал уже надеяться, что это проклятье не тяготеет больше
над нашей семьей, что оно рассеялось после гибели старшего поколения. Однако я слишком рано успокоился. Вчера утром меня постиг удар в той же самой форме, в какой он постиг моего отца…
Молодой человек достал из кармана смятый конверт и, повернувшись к столу, высыпал на скатерть пять маленьких сухих зернышек апельсина.
He shook out five little dried orange pips.
– Вот конверт, – продолжал он. – Почтовый штемпель – Лондон, Восточный район. Внутри те
же самые слова, которые были в письме, полученном моим отцом; «К. К. К.», а затем: «Положите
бумаги на солнечные часы».
– Что вы сделали? – спросил Холмс.
– Ничего.
– Ничего?
– По правде говоря, – он опустил лицо на тонкие белые руки, – я почувствовал себя беспомощным, как жалкий кролик, к которому приближается змея. По-видимому, я во власти какой-то непреодолимой и неумолимой силы, от которой не могут спасти никакие предосторожности.
– Что вы! Что вы! – воскликнул Шерлок Холмс. – Вы должны действовать, иначе вы погибнете.
Только энергия может спасти вас. Теперь не время предаваться отчаянию.
– Я был в полиции.
– Ну, и?..
– Но там с улыбкой выслушали мой рассказ. Я убежден, что инспектор считает эти письма
чьей-то шуткой, а смерть моих родных, как и установил суд присяжных, – несчастным случаем, никак не связанным с этими предупреждениями.
Холмс потряс в воздухе сжатыми кулаками.
– Невероятная тупость! – воскликнул он.
– Все же ко мне прикомандировали полицейского, который все время дежурит в моем доме.
– Он пришел с вами сейчас?
– Нет, ему приказано находиться при доме.
Холмс снова потряс в воздухе кулаками.
– Зачем вы пришли ко мне? – спросил он. – И главное, почему вы не пришли ко мне сразу?
– Я не знал. Только сегодня я говорил о моих опасениях с майором Прендергастом, и он посоветовал мне обратиться к вам.
– Ведь уже два дня, как вы получили письмо. Вам следовало начать действовать раньше. У вас
нет, я полагаю, других данных, кроме тех, которые вы мне сообщили? Нет каких-либо наводящих
подробностей, которые могли бы вам помочь?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Есть одна вещь, – сказал Джон Опеншоу. Он пошарил в кармане пальто и, вынув кусок выцветшей синей бумаги, положил его на стол. – Мне помнится, – сказал он, – что в день, когда дядя
жег бумаги, маленькие несгоревшие полоски, лежавшие среди пепла, были такого же цвета. Этот
лист я нашел на полу дядиной комнаты и склонен думать, что это одна из бумаг, которая случайно
отлетела от остальных и таким образом избежала уничтожения. Кроме упоминания зернышек, я не
вижу в этой бумаге ничего, что могло бы нам помочь. Я думаю, что это страница дневника. Почерк,
несомненно, дядин.
Холмс повернул лампу, и мы оба нагнулись над листом бумаги, неровные края которого свидетельствовали о том, что лист был вырван из книги. Наверху была надпись: «Март 1869 года», а внизу
следующие загадочные заметки:
4-го. Гудзон явился. Прежняя платформа.
7-го. Посланы зернышки Мак-Коули, Парамору и Джону Свейну из СентАвгустина.
9-го. Мак-Коули убрался.
10-го. Джон Свейн убрался.
12-го. Посетили Парамора. Все в порядке.
– Благодарю вас, – сказал Холмс, складывая бумагу и возвращая ее нашему посетителю.-Теперь
вы не должны терять ни минуты. Мы даже не можем тратить время на обсуждение того, что вы мне
сообщили. Вы должны немедленно вернуться домой и действовать.
– Что я должен делать?
– Есть только одно дело, и оно должно быть выполнено немедленно. Вы должны положить бумагу, которую только что нам показали, в латунную шкатулку, описанную вами. Вы должны приложить записку и в ней сообщить, что все остальные бумаги были сожжены вашим дядей и остался
только этот лист. Вы должны заявить это словами, внушающими доверие. Написав такое письмо, немедленно поставьте шкатулку на диск солнечных часов, как вам указано. Вы понимаете?
– Вполне понимаю.
– Не думайте в настоящее время о мести или о чем-либо подобном. Я полагаю, что этого мы
могли бы добиться законным путем, но ведь нам еще предстоит сплести свою сеть, тогда как их сеть
уже сплетена. Прежде всего надо отстранить непосредственную опасность, угрожающую вам. А затем уже выяснить это таинственное дело и наказать виновных.
– Благодарю вас, – сказал молодой человек, вставая и надевая плащ. – Вы вернули мне жизнь и
надежду. Я поступлю так, как вы мне советуете.
– Не теряйте ни минуты. И главное, берегите себя, так как не может быть сомнения, что вам угрожает весьма реальная и большая опасность. Каким путем вы думаете вернуться домой?
– Поездом, с вокзала Ватерлоо.
– Еще нет девяти часов. На улицах будет очень людно, так что, я надеюсь, вы будете в безопасности. И все же вы должны очень остерегаться врагов.
– Я вооружен.
– Это хорошо. Завтра я примусь за ваше дело.
– Значит, я увижу вас в Хоршеме?
– Нет, секрет вашего дела – в Лондоне, и здесь я буду его искать.
– В таком случае, я приду к вам через день или два и сообщу все, что будет выяснено насчет
шкатулки и бумаг. Я в точности выполню все ваши советы.
Он пожал нам руки и простился.
Ветер по-прежнему завывал и дождь стучал в окна. Казалось, этот странный рассказ навеян
обезумевшей стихией, занесен к нам, как морская трава заносится бурей, и теперь снова поглощен
ею.
Холмс сидел некоторое время молча, опустив голову и устремив взгляд на красное пламя камина. Затем он закурил трубку и, откинувшись на спинку кресла, стал следить за синими кольцами дыма, которые нагоняли друг друга под потолком.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
His eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.
– Я думаю, Уотсон, – заметил он наконец, – что в нашей практике не было более опасного и
фантастического дела.
– Но вы составили себе определенное представление о характере этих опасностей? – спросил я.
– Здесь не может быть сомнения относительно их характера,
– ответил он.
– Но в чем дело? Кто этот К. К. К. и почему он преследует несчастную семью?
Шерлок Холмс закрыл глаза и, опершись на подлокотники кресла, соединил концы пальцев.
– Истинный мыслитель, – заметил он, – увидев один-единственный факт во всей полноте, может вывести из него не только всю цепь событий, приведших к нему, но также и все последствия, вытекающие из него. Как Кювье20 мог правильно описать целое животное на основании одной кости,
так и наблюдатель, основательно изучивший одно звено в серии событий, должен быть в состоянии
точно установить все остальные звенья – и предшествующие, и последующие. Но чтобы довести искусство мышления до высшей точки, необходимо, чтобы мыслитель мог использовать все установленные факты, а для этого ему нужны самые обширные познания. Если мне не изменяет память, вы в
ранние дни нашей дружбы очень точно определили границы моих знаний.
– Да, – ответил я, смеясь, – это был необыкновенный документ. Я помню, что философия, астрономия и политика стояли под знаком нуля. Познание в ботанике – колеблющиеся, в геологии –
глубокие, поскольку дело касается пятен грязи из любого района в пределах пятидесяти миль вокруг
Лондона; в химии – эксцентрические; в анатомии – разрозненные; в области уголовной литературы и
судебных отчетов – исключительные: при этом скрипач, боксер, владеет шпагой, юрист, отравляет
себя кокаином и табаком. Таковы были главнейшие пункты моего анализа.
Холмс усмехнулся при последних словах.
– Что ж, я говорю сейчас, как говорил и тогда, что человек должен обставить чердачок своего
мозга всем, что ему, вероятно, понадобится, а остальные знания он должен сложить в чулан при своей библиотеке, откуда может достать их в случае надобности. Для такого дела, какое было предложено нам сегодня вечером, мы, конечно, должны мобилизовать все доступные нам ресурсы. Дайте
мне, пожалуйста, том на букву «К» из Американкой энциклопедии. Он стоит на полке, которая рядом
с вами. Благодарю вас. Теперь обсудим все обстоятельства и посмотрим, какой можно сделать из них
вывод. Начать мы должны с предположения, что у полковника Опеншоу были весьма серьезные причины, заставившие его покинуть Америку. В его годы люди не склонны нарушать все свои привычки
20 20Кювье (1769-1832) – знаменитый французский ученый, положивший начало палеонтологии (наука об ископаемых
животных).
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
и добровольно отказываться от прелестного климата Флориды ради уединенной жизни в английском
провинциальном городке. Его крайнее пристрастие к уединению в Англии подсказывает мысль, что
он боялся кого-то или чего-то. Поэтому мы можем принять как рабочую гипотезу, что то был страх
перед кем-то или чем-то, что заставило его покинуть Америку. О том, чего именно он боялся, мы
можем судить только на основании зловещих писем, которые получали он и его наследники. Вы заметили почтовые штемпели этих писем?
– Первое было из Пондишерри, второе – из Данди и третье – из Лондона.
– Из Восточного Лондона! Какой вы монете сделать отсюда вывод?
– Это все океанские порты. По-видимому, писавший находился на борту корабля.
– Великолепно! У нас уже есть ключ. Вероятно, весьма вероятно, что писавший письма находился на борту корабля. А теперь посмотрим на это дело с другой стороны. В случае с Пондишерри
прошло семь недель между угрозой и ее выполнением. В случае с Данди между угрозой и выполнением прошло всего три-четыре дня. Это вас наводит на какую-нибудь мысль?
– Большее расстояние, которое надо было в первом случае преодолеть.
– Но ведь письмо тоже должно было пройти большое расстояние.
– Тогда я не понимаю, в чем дело.
– Есть основание предполагать, что судно, на котором находится этот человек – или, может
быть, их несколько, – парусное судно. Похоже на то, что они всегда посылали свои странные предупреждения или знаки перед тем, как отправиться на выполнение своего дела. Вы видите, как быстро
дело последовало за предупреждением, посланным из Данди. Если бы они ехали из Пондишерри пароходом, они прибыли бы почти одновременно с письмом. Но прошло семь недель. Я думаю, что
семь недель представляют разницу между скоростью почтового парохода, доставившего письмо, и
скоростью парусника, доставившего автора письма.
– Это возможно.
– Это более чем возможно. Это вероятно. Теперь вы видите смертельную опасность в нашем
последнем деле и понимаете, почему я настаивал, чтобы молодой Опеншоу был осторожен. Удар
всегда настигал к концу срока, который нужен был отправителям письма, чтобы пройти расстояние
на паруснике. Но ведь это письмо послано из Лондона, и поэтому мы не можем рассчитывать на отсрочку!
– Боже мой! – воскликнул я. – Что значит это беспощадное преследование?
– Очевидно, бумаги, увезенные Опеншоу, представляют жизненный интерес для человека или
людей, находящихся на паруснике. Полагаю, что там не один человек. Один человек не мог бы совершить два убийства таким образом, чтобы ввести в заблуждение судебное следствие. В этом должно было участвовать несколько человек, притом изобретательных и решительных. Свои бумаги они
решили получить, в чьих бы руках те ни находились. Таким образом, вы видите что «К. К. К.» перестают быть инициалами человека, а становятся знаком целого общества.
– Но какого общества?
– Вы никогда не слышали о Ку-клукс-клане? – сказал Шерлок Холмс, нагибаясь и понижая голос.
– Никогда не слышал.
Холмс перелистал страницы тома, лежавшего у него на коленях:
– Вот что здесь говорится:
«Ку-Клукс-Клан – название, происходящее от сходства со звуком взводимого затвора винтовки. Это ужасное тайное общество было создано бывшими солдатами Южной
армии после гражданской войны и быстро образовало местные отделения в различных
штатах, главным образом в Теннесси, в Луизиане, в обеих Каролинах, в Джорджии и
Флориде. Это общество использовало свои силы в политических целях, главным образом
для того, чтобы терроризировать негритянских избирателей, а также для убийства или изгнания из страны тех, кто противился его взглядам. Их преступлениям обычно предшествовало предупреждение, посылаемое намеченному лицу в фантастической, но широко известной форме: в некоторых частях страны – дубовые листья, в других – семена дыни или
зернышки апельсина. Получив это предупреждение, человек должен был либо открыто
отречься от прежних взглядов, либо покинуть страну. Если он не обращал внимания на
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
предупреждение, его неизменно постигала смерть, обычно странная и непредвиденная.
Общество было так хорошо организовано и его методы были настолько продуманны, что
едва ли известен хоть один случай, когда человеку удалось безнаказанно пренебречь предупреждением или когда были раскрыты виновники злодеяния. Несколько лет организация процветала, несмотря на усилия правительства Соединенных Штатов и прогрессивных кругов Юга. В 1869 году движение неожиданно прекратилось, хотя отдельные
вспышки расовой ненависти наблюдались и позже…»
Заметьте, – сказал Холмс, откладывая том энциклопедии, – что внезапное прекращение деятельности общества совпало с отъездом из Америки Опеншоу, когда он увез с собой бумаги этой организации. Весьма возможно, что тут налицо и причина и следствие. Не приходится удивляться, что
за молодым Опеншоу и его семьей следят беспощадные люди. Вы понимаете, что эта опись и дневники могут опорочить виднейших деятелей Юга и что многие не заснут спокойно, пока эти бумаги не
будут у них в руках?
– Значит, страница, которую мы видели…
– Такая, какую можно было ожидать. Если мне не изменяет память, там было написано: «Посланы зернышки А. Б. В.» – то есть послали им предупреждение. Затем последовательно идут записи,
что А и Б убрались, то есть покинули страну, и что В навестили. Боюсь, это плохо кончилось для В.
Я думаю, доктор, нам удастся пролить некоторый свет на это темное дело. А тем временем единственное спасение для молодого Опеншоу – действовать так, как я ему посоветовал. Сегодня ничего
больше мы не можем ни сказать, ни сделать… Передайте мне мою скрипку, и попытаемся на полчаса
забыть отвратительную погоду и еще более отвратительные поступки людей.
К утру буря стихла, и солнце тускло светило сквозь туманный покров, нависший над Лондоном. Шерлок Холмс уже завтракал, когда я спустился вниз.
– Извините, что я начал без вас, – сказал он. – Я предвижу, что мне придется много поработать
по делу молодого Опеншоу.
– Какие шаги вы собираетесь предпринять? – спросил я.
– Это в значительной степени зависит от результатов моих первых расследований. Может быть,
мне придется еще съездить в Хоршем.
– Вы не собираетесь прежде всего поехать туда?
– Нет, я начну с Сити. Позвоните, и служанка принесет нам кофе.
В ожидании кофе я взял со стола газету и стал бегло просматривать ее. Я увидел заголовок, от
которого у меня похолодело сердце.
– Холмс, – воскликнул я, – вы опоздали!
– А-а! – сказал он, отставляя чашку. – Я опасался, что так и будет. Как это произошло?-Он говорил спокойно, но я видел, что он глубоко взволнован.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Holmes,» I cried, «you are too late.»
Мне бросилось в глаза имя Опеншоу и заголовок: «Трагедия у моста Ватерлоо». Вот что было
написано:
«Вчера между девятью и десятью вечера констебль Кук, дежуривший у моста Ватерлоо, услышал крик о помощи и всплеск воды. Однако ночь была очень темная, бушевала буря, так что, несмотря на смелые попытки нескольких прохожих, оказалось невозможным спасти тонувшего. Был дан сигнал тревоги, и с помощью речной полиции тело
удалось найти. Это был молодой джентльмен, имя которого, как видно по конверту, найденному в его кармане, Джон Опеншоу, проживавший вблизи Хоршема. Предполагают,
что он спешил к последнему поезду, отходившему со станции Ватерлоо, и что в спешке
при исключительной темноте сбился с дороги и шагнул через край одной из маленьких
пристаней речного пароходства. На теле не было обнаружено следов насилия, и не может
быть сомнения в том, что покойный оказался жертвой несчастного случая; это должно заставить власти обратить внимание на состояние речных пристаней».
Несколько минут мы сидели молча. Я никогда не видел Холмса таким угнетенным.
– Это наносит удар моему самолюбию, – сказал он наконец.
– Бесспорно, самолюбие мелкое чувство, но с этим ничего не поделаешь. Теперь это становится
для меня личным делом, и если бог пошлет мне здоровье, я выловлю всю банду. Он пришел ко мне за
помощью, и я же послал его на смерть!
Он вскочил со стула, зашагал по комнате с пылающим румянцем на бледном лице, нервно
сжимая и разжимая свои длинные, тонкие пальцы.
– Хитрые дьяволы! – выкрикнул он наконец. – Как им удалось заманить его туда, вниз, к реке?
Набережная не лежит по дороге к станции. На мосту, конечно, даже в такую ночь было слишком
людно. Ну, Уотсон, посмотрим, кто в конечном счете победит. Сейчас я пойду!
– В полицию?
– Нет, я сам буду полицией. Я сплету паутину, и пусть тогда полиция ловит в нее мух, но не
раньше.
Весь день я был занят своей медицинской практикой и вернулся на Бейкер-стрит поздно вечером. Шерлок Холмс еще не приходил. Было почти десять часов, когда он вошел, бледный и усталый.
Он подошел к буфету и, отломив кусок хлеба, стал жадно жевать его, запивая большими глотками
воды.
– Проголодались? – заметил я.
– Умираю от голода. Совершенно забыл поесть. С утреннего завтрака у меня не было во рту ни
крошки.
– Ничего?
– Ни крошки. Мне некогда было об этом думать.
– А как ваши успехи?
– Хороши.
– Вы нашли ключ?
– Они у меня в руках. Молодой Опеншоу недолго останется неотмщенным. Знаете, Уотсон, поставим на них их собственное дьявольское клеймо! Разве это плохо придумано?
– Что вы хотите сказать?
Он взял из буфета апельсин, разделил его на дольки и выдавил на стол зернышки. Из них он
взял пять и положил в конверт. На внутренней стороне конверта он написал: «Ш.X. за Д.О.». Затем
он запечатал конверт и адресовал его: «Капитану Джеймсу Келгуну, парусник „Одинокая звезда“.
Саванна, Джорджия».
– Письмо будет ждать Келгуна, когда он войдет в порт, – сказал Холмс, тихо смеясь. – Это ему
обеспечит бессонную ночь. Я уверен, что он сочтет письмо вестником той же судьбы, какая постигла
Опеншоу.
– А кто этот капитан Келгун?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Вожак всей шайки. Я доберусь и до других, но он будет первым.
– Как вы его обнаружили?
Он достал из кармана большой лист бумаги, сплошь исписанный датами и именами.
– Я провел весь день над ллойдовскими журналами и связками старых бумаг, прослеживая
дальнейшую судьбу каждого корабля, прибывавшего в Пондишерри в январе и феврале 83 года. За
эти месяцы было отмечено тридцать шесть судов значительного водоизмещения; из них одно судно,
«Одинокая звезда», сразу привлекло мое внимание, так как местом отправления указан был Лондон,
между тем «Одинокая звезда» – это прозвище одного из штатов Америки.
– Кажется, Техаса.
– Я не был в этом уверен, не уверен и сейчас. Но я знал, что это судно должно быть американского происхождения.
– И что же?
– Я просмотрел записи прихода и ухода судов в Данди, и, когда я обнаружил, что парусник
«Одинокая звезда» был там в январе 85 года, мои подозрения обратились в уверенность. Тогда я навел справки относительно судов, находящихся в настоящее время в Лондонском порту.
– И что же?
– «Одинокая звезда» прибыла сюда на прошлой неделе. Я спустился к докам Альберта и узнал,
что сегодня утром с ранним приливом «Одинокая звезда» ушла вниз по реке, чтобы последовать обратно в Саванну. Я телеграфировал в Гревзенд и узнал, что «Одинокая звезда» прошла там недавно,
и так как ветер восточный, я не сомневаюсь, что она уже миновала Гудуин и находится недалеко от
острова Уайт.
– Что же вы теперь сделаете?
– О, Келгун теперь в моих руках! Он и два матроса, как я узнал, – единственные американцы на
корабле. Все остальные финны и немцы. Я знаю также, что прошлую ночь все трое провели не на
судне. Это мне сказал грузчик, который работал на погрузке «Одинокой звезды». Прежде чем парусник достигнет Саванны, почтовый пароход доставит мое письмо, а телеграф сообщит полиции в Саванне, что эти три джентльмена крайне нужны здесь в связи с обвинением их в убийстве.
Однако в самых лучших человеческих планах всегда оказывается какая-нибудь трещина, и
убийцам Джона Опеншоу не суждено было получить зернышки апельсина, которые показали бы им,
что другой человек, такой же хитрый и решительный, как они, напал на их след.
В том году равноденственные штормы были очень продолжительны и жестоки. Мы долго ждали из Саванны вестей об «Одинокой звезде», но так и не дождались. Наконец мы узнали, что где-то
далеко, в Атлантике, видели разбитую корму корабля, залитую волной; на ней были вырезаны буквы
«О. 3.». Это все, что суждено было нам узнать о судьбе «Одинокой звезды».

Айза Уитни приучился курить опий. Еще в колледже, прочитав книгу де Куинси, в которой
описываются сны и ощущения курильщика опия, он начал подмешивать опий к своему табаку, чтобы
пережить то, что пережил этот писатель. Как и многие другие, он скоро убедился, что начать курить
гораздо легче, чем бросить, и в продолжение многих лет был рабом своей страсти, внушая сожаление
и ужас всем своим друзьям. Я так и вижу перед собой его желтое, одутловатое лицо, его глаза с набрякшими веками и сузившимися зрачками, его тело, бессильно лежащее в кресле, – жалкие развалины человека.
Однажды вечером, в июне 1889 года, как раз в то время, когда начинаешь уже зевать и посмат-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ривать на часы, в квартире моей раздался звонок. Я выпрямился в кресле, а жена, опустив свое шитье
на колени, недовольно поморщилась.
– Пациент! – сказала она. – Тебе придется идти к больному.
Я вздохнул, потому что незадолго до этого вернулся домой после целого дня утомительной работы.
Мы услышали шум отворяемой двери и чьи-то торопливые шаги в коридоре. Дверь нашей комнаты распахнулась, и вошла дама в темном платье, с черной вуалью на лице.
– Извините, что я ворвалась так поздно, – начала она и вдруг, потеряв самообладание, бросилась к моей жене, обняла ее и зарыдала у нее на плече. – Ох, у меня такое горе! – воскликнула она. –
Мне так нужна помощь!
– Да ведь это Кэт Уитни, – сказала жена, приподняв ее вуаль. – Как ты испугала меня, Кэт! Мне
и в голову не пришло, что это ты.
– Я обращаюсь к тебе, потому что не знаю, что делать.
Это было обычным явлением. Люди, с которыми случалась беда, устремлялись к моей жене,
как птицы к маяку.
– И правильно поступила. Садись поудобнее, выпей вина с водой и рассказывай, что случилось.
Может быть, ты хочешь, чтобы я отправила Джеймса спать?
– О нет, нет! От доктора я тоже жду совета и помощи. Дело идет об Айзе. Вот уже два дня, как
его нет дома. Я так боюсь за него!
Не в первый раз беседовала она с нами о своем несчастном муже – со мной как с доктором, а с
женой как со своей старой школьной подругой. Мы утешали и успокаивали ее как могли. Знает ли
она, где находится ее муж? Нельзя ли съездить за ним и привезти его домой?
Оказалось, что это вполне возможно. Ей было известно, что за последнее время он обычно курил опий в притоне, который находился на одной из восточных улиц Сити. До сих пор его оргии всегда ограничивались одним днем и к вечеру он возвращался домой в полном изнеможении, совершенно разбитый, но на этот раз он отсутствует уже сорок восемь часов и, конечно, лежит там среди
всяких подозрительных личностей, сдыхая яд или отсыпаясь после курения. Она была убеждена, что
он находился именно там, в «Золотом самородке» на Эппер-Суондем-лейн. Но что она может сделать? Как может она, молодая, застенчивая, робкая женщина, войти в такое место и вырвать своего
мужа из толпы подонков?
Не пойти ли нам с ней вместе? Впрочем, зачем ей идти? Я лечил Айзу Уитни и, как доктор, мог
повлиять на него. Без нее мне будет легче справиться с ним. Я дал ей слово, что в течение ближайших двух часов усажу ее мужа в кэб и отправлю домой, если он действительно находится в «Золотом
самородке».
Через десять минут, покинув уютную гостиную, я уже мчался в экипаже на восток. Я знал, что
мне предстоит довольно необычное дело, но в действительности оно оказалось еще более странным,
чем я ожидал.
Сначала все шло хорошо. Эппер-Суондем-лейн – грязный переулок, расположенный позади
высоких верфей, которые тянутся на восток вдоль северного берега рек'и, вплоть до Лондонского
моста. Притон, который я разыскивал, находился в подвале между грязной лавкой и кабаком; в эту
черную дыру, как в пещеру, вели крутые ступени. Посередине каждой ступеньки образовалась ложбинка – такое множество пьяных ног спускалось и поднималось по ним.
Приказав кэбу подождать, я спустился вниз. При свете мигающей керосиновой лампочки, висевшей над дверью, я отыскал щеколду и вошел в длинную низкую комнату, полную густого коричневого дыма; вдоль стен тянулись деревянные нары, как на баке эмигрантского корабля.
Сквозь мрак я не без труда разглядел безжизненные тела, лежащие в странных, фантастических
позах: со сгорбленными плечами, с поднятыми коленями, с запрокинутыми головами, с торчащими
вверх подбородками. То там, то тут замечал я темные, потухшие глаза, бессмысленно уставившиеся
на меня. Среди тьмы вспыхивали крохотные красные огоньки, тускневшие по мере того, как уменьшалось количество яда в маленьких металлических трубках. Большинство лежали молча, но иные
бормотали что-то себе под нос, а иные вели беседы странными низкими монотонными голосами, то
возбуждаясь и торопясь, то внезапно смолкая, причем никто не слушал своего собеседника – всякий
был поглощен лишь собственными мыслями. В самом дальнем конце подвала стояла маленькая жаровня с пылающими углями, возле которой на трехногом стуле сидел высокий, худой старик, опустив подбородок на кулаки, положив локти на колени и неподвижно глядя в огонь.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Как только я вошел, ко мне кинулся смуглый малаец, протянул мне трубку, порцию опия и показал свободное место на нарах.
– Спасибо, я не могу здесь остаться, – сказал я. – Здесь находится мой друг, мистер Айза Уитни.
Мне нужно поговорить с ним.
Справа от меня что-то шевельнулось, я услышал чье-то восклицание и, вглядевшись во тьму,
увидел Уитни, который пристально смотрел на меня, бледный, угрюмый и какой-то встрепанный.
– Боже, да это Уотсон! – проговорил он.
Он находился в состоянии самой плачевной реакции после опьянения.
– Который теперь час, Уотсон?
– Скоро одиннадцать.
– А какой нынче день?
– Пятница, девятнадцатое июня.
– Неужели? А я думал, что еще среда. Нет, сегодня среда. Признайтесь, что вы пошутили. И что
вам за охота пугать человека!
Он закрыл лицо ладонями и зарыдал.
– Говорю вам, что сегодня пятница. Ваша жена ждет вас уже два дня. Право, вам должно быть
стыдно!
– Я и стыжусь. Но вы что-то путаете, Уотсон, я здесь всего несколько часов. Три трубки… четыре трубки… забыл сколько! Но я поеду с вами домой. Я не хочу, чтобы Кэт волновалась… Бедная
маленькая Кэт! Дайте мне руку. Есть у вас кэб?
– Есть. Ждет у дверей.
– В таком случае, я уеду сейчас же. Но я им должен. Узнайте, сколько я должен, Уотсон. Я совсем размяк и ослабел. Нет сил даже расплатиться.
Staring into the fire.
По узкому проходу между двумя рядами спящих, задерживая дыхание, чтобы не вдыхать одуряющих паров ядовитого зелья, я отправился разыскивать хозяина. Поровнявшись с высоким стариком, сидевшим у жаровни, я почувствовал, что меня кто-то дергает за пиджак, и услышал шепот:
– Пройдите мимо меня, а потом оглянитесь.
Эти слова я расслышал вполне отчетливо. Их мог произнести только находившийся рядом со
мной старик. Однако у него по-прежнему был такой вид, будто он погружен в себя и ничего кругом
не замечает. Он сидел тощий, сморщенный, согбенный под тяжестью лет; трубка с опием висела у
него между колен, словно вывалившись из его обессиленных пальцев. Я сделал два шага вперед и
оглянулся. Мне понадобилось все мое самообладание, чтобы не вскрикнуть от удивления. Он повернулся так, что лица его не мог видеть никто, кроме меня. Спина его выпрямилась, морщины разгла-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
дились, в тусклых глазах появился их обычный блеск. Возле огня сидел, посмеиваясь над моим удивлением, не кто иной, как Шерлок Холмс. Он сделал мне украдкой знак, чтобы я подошел к нему, и
опять превратился в дрожащего старика с отвислой губой.
«Holmes!» I whispered.
– Холмс! – прошептал я. – Что делаете вы в этом притоне?
– Говорите как можно тише, – прошептал он, – у меня превосходный слух. Если вы избавитесь
от вашего ошалелого друга, я буду счастлив немного побеседовать с вами.
– Меня за дверью ждет кэб.
– Так отправьте вашего друга домой одного в этом кэбе. Вы можете за него не бояться, так как
он слишком слаб, чтобы впутаться в какой-нибудь скандал. Будет лучше всего, если вы пошлете с
кучером записку вашей жене, что вы встретили меня и остались со мной. Подождите меня на улице, я
выйду через пять минут.
Трудно отказать Шерлоку Холмсу: его требования всегда так определенны и точны и выражены таким повелительным тоном. К тому же я чувствовал, что, как только я усажу Уитни в кэб, я уже
выполню все свои обязательства по отношению к нему и мне уже ничто не помешает принять участие в одном из тех необычайных приключений, которые составляли повседневную практику моего
знаменитого друга.
Помогать Шерлоку Холмсу в его изысканиях было для меня наивысшим счастьем. Поэтому я
тотчас же написал записку жене, заплатил за Уитни, усадил его в кэб и стал терпеливо ждать неподалеку от дома. Кэб сразу же скрылся во мраке. Через несколько минут из курильни вышел старик, и я
зашагал за ним по улице. Два квартала он прошел не разгибая спины и неуверенно шаркая старческими ногами. Потом торопливо оглянулся, выпрямился и от души захохотал. Предо мною был Шерлок Холмс.
– Вероятно, Уотсон, – оказал он, – вы вообразили, что я пристрастился к курению опия.
– По правде сказать, я действительно был удивлен, когда увидел вас в этой трущобе.
– И все же я удивился еще больше, чем вы, когда увидел в этой трущобе вас.
– Я искал там друга.
– А я – врага.
– Врага?
– Да. Короче говоря, Уотсон, я занят чрезвычайно любопытным делом и надеялся узнать коечто из бессвязной болтовни очумелых курильщиков опия. Прежде мне это иногда удавалось. Если бы
меня узнали в той трущобе, жизнь моя не стоила бы медяка, так как я уже бывал там не раз и негодяй
ласкар, хозяин притона, поклялся расправиться со мною. На задворках этого дома, возле верфи святого Павла, есть потайная дверца, которая могла бы порассказать много диковинных историй о том,
что выбрасывают через нее в черные, безлунные ночи.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Неужели трупы?
– Да, Уотсон, трупы. Мы с вами были бы миллионерами, если бы получили по тысяче фунтов
за каждого несчастного, убитого в этом притоне. Это самая страшная ловушка на всем берегу реки, и
я опасаюсь, что Невилл Сент-Клер, попавший в нее, никогда не вернется домой. Но мы тоже устроим
ловушку.
Шерлок Холмс сунул два пальца в рот и резко свистнул. Тотчас же издалека донесся такой же
свист, а затем мы услышали грохот колес и стук копыт.
– Ну что же, Уотсон, – сказал Холмс, когда из темноты вынырнула двуколка с двумя фонарями,
бросавшими яркие полосы света, – поедете вы со мною?
– Если буду вам полезен…
– Верный товарищ всегда полезен. В моей комнате в «Кедрах» имеются две кровати.
– В «Кедрах»?
– Да. Так называется дом мистера Сент-Клера. Я буду жить в его доме, пока не распутаю это
дело.
– Где же этот дом?
– В Кенте, неподалеку от Ли. Нам нужно проехать семь миль.
– Ничего не понимаю.
– Вполне естественно. Сейчас я вам все объясню. Садитесь… Хорошо, Джон, вы нам больше не
нужны. Вот вам полкроны. Ждите меня завтра часов в одиннадцать. Дайте мне вожжи. Прощайте.
Он хлестнул лошадь, и мы понеслись по бесконечным темным, пустынным улицам и наконец
очутились на каком-то широком мосту, под которым медленно текли мутные воды реки. За мостом
были такие же улицы с кирпичными домами; тишина этих улиц нарушалась только тяжелыми размеренными шагами полицейских да песнями и криками запоздалых гуляк.
He flicked the horse with his whip.
Черные тучи медленно ползли по небу, и в разрывах между ними то там, то здесь тускло мерцали звезды. Холмс молча правил лошадью, в глубокой задумчивости опустив голову на грудь, а я
сидел рядом с ним, стараясь отгадать, что занимает его мысли, и не смея прервать его раздумье. Мы
проехали несколько миль и уже пересекали пояс пригородных вилл, когда он наконец очнулся, передернул плечами и закурил трубку.
– Вы наделены великим талантом молчания, Уотсон, – сказал он. – Благодаря этой способности
вы незаменимый товарищ. Однако сейчас мне нужен человек, с которым я мог бы поболтать, чтобы
разогнать неприятные мысли. Представления не имею, что я скажу этой маленькой милой женщине,
когда она встретит меня на пороге.
– Вы забываете, что я ничего не знаю.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– У меня как раз хватит времени рассказать вам все, пока мы доедем до Ли. Дело кажется до
сметного простым, а между тем я не знаю, как за него взяться. Нитей много, но ни за одну из них я не
могу ухватиться как следует. Я расскажу вам все, Уотсон, и, быть может, вам удастся найти хоть искру света в окружающем мраке.
– Рассказывайте.
– Несколько лет назад – точнее, в мае 1884 года – в Ли появился джентльмен по имени Невилл
Сент-Клер, который., видимо, имел много денег. Он снял большую виллу, разбил вокруг нее прекрасный сад и зажил на широкую ногу, по-барски. Мало-помалу он подружился с соседями и в 1887
году женился на дочери местного пивовара, от которой теперь имеет уже двоих детей. Определенных
занятий у него нет, но он прянимаег участие в нескольких коммерческих предприятиях и обычно каждое утро ездит в город, возвращаясь оттуда с поездом 5.14. Мистеру Сеят-Клеру теперь тридцать
семь лет. Живет он скромно; он хороший муж и любящий отец; люди, встречавшиеся с ним, отзываются о нем превосходно. Могу еще прибавить, что долгов у него всего восемьдесят восемь фунтов
десять шиллингов, а в банке на его текущем счету двести двадцать фунтов стерлингов. Следовательно, нет оснований предполагать какие-нибудь денежные затруднения.
В прошлый понедельник мистер Невилл Сент-Клер отправился в город раньше обычного, сказав перед отъездом, что у него два важных дела и что он привезет своему сынишке коробку с кубиками. Случайно в тот же самый понедельник, вскоре после его отъезда, жена его получила телеграмму, что на ее имя в Эбердинском пароходном обществе получена небольшая, но весьма ценная
посылка, которую она ожидала уже давно. Если вы хорошо знаете Лондон, вам известно, что контора
этого пароходного общества помещается на Фресно-стрит, которая упирается в Эппер-Суондемлейн, где вы нашли меня сегодня вечером. Миссис Сеит-Клер позавтракала, отправилась в город,
сделала кое-какие покупки, заехала в кантору общества, получила там свою посылку и в четыре часа
тридцать пять минут шла по Суондем-лейн, направляясь к вокзалу… До сих пор вам все ясно, не
правда ли?
– Конечно, здесь нет ничего непонятного.
– Если помните, в понедельник было очень жарко, и миссис Сент-Клер шла медленно, поглядывая, нет ли где кэба, так как ей очень не понравился район города, в котором она очутилась. И вот,
идя по Суондем-лейп, она внезапно услышала крик и вся похолодела, увидев своего мужа, который
смотрел на нее из окна второго этажа какого-то дома и, как ей показалось, жестами звал ее к себе.
Окно было раскрыто, и она ясно разглядела лицо мужа, показавшееся ей чрезвычайно взволнованным. Он протянул к ней обе руки и вдруг исчез так внезапно, будто его насильно оттащили от окна.
Однако ее зоркий женский взгляд успел заметить, что, хотя он одет в тот же черный пиджак, в котором он уехал из дому, на нем нет ни воротничка, ни галстука.
Уверенная, что с мужем случилась беда, она сбежала вниз по ступенькам (дом был тот самый, в
котором помещается трущоба, где вы нашли меня нынче вечером) и, пробежав через переднюю комнату, попыталась подняться по лестнице, ведущей в верхние этажи. Но у лестницы она наткнулась на
негодяя Ласкара, о котором я вам сейчас говорил. Ласкар с помощью своего подручного выставил ее
на улицу. У него есть подручный, датчанин. Обезумев от ужаса, она побежала по улице и, к счастью,
на Фресно-стрит встретила полицейских, которые совершали обход во главе с инспектором.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
At the foot of the stairs she met this Lascar scoundrel.
Инспектор с двумя констеблями последовал за миссис Сент-Клер, и, несмотря на упорное сопротивление хозяина, им удалось проникнуть в ту комнату, в окне которой она видела мужа. Но
здесь его не оказалось. Во всем этаже не нашли никого, кроме какого-то калеки отвратительной
внешности, который, видимо, там и живет. И он и ласкар упорно клялись, что тут никого больше не
было. Они так решительно все отрицали, что инспектор стал было уже сомневаться, не ошиблась ли
миссис Сент-Клер, как вдруг она с криком кинулась к небольшому деревянному ящичку, стоявшему
на столе, и сорвала с него крышку. Из ящичка посыпались детские кубики. То была игрушка, которую ее муж обещал привезти из города.
Эта находка и внезапное смущение калеки убедили инспектора в серьезности дела. Комнаты
были тщательно обысканы, и обыск привел к открытию гнусного преступления.
Убранство этой квартиры, конечно, убогое. Передняя комната представляет собою что-то вроде
гостиной, а рядом с ней помещается небольшая спальня, окно которой выходит на задворки одной из
верфей. Между верфью и окном спальни есть узкий канал, который высыхает во время отлива, а во
время прилива наполняется водой на четыре с половиной фута. Окно в спальне широкое и открывается снизу.
При осмотре были обнаружены на подоконнике следы крови; несколько кровавых пятен нашли
также и на деревянном полу. За шторой в передней комнате удалось обнаружить всю одежду мистера
Невилла Сент-Клера. Не было только его пиджака. Его ботинки, его носки, его шляпа, его часы – все
оказалось тут. На одежде не нашли никаких следов насилия. Но сам мистер Невилл Сент-Клер бесследно исчез. Исчезнуть он мог только через окно, и зловещие кровавые пятна на подоконнике ясно
указывали, что вряд ли ему удалось спастись вплавь, тем более что в тот час, когда совершалась трагедия, прилив достиг наивысшего уровня.
Теперь обратимся к негодяям, на которых падает подозрение. Ласкар известен как человек с
темным прошлым, но из рассказа миссис Сент-Клер мы знаем, что через несколько мгновений после
появления ее мужа в окне он находился внизу, и, следовательно, его можно считать лишь соучастником преступления. Он отрицает всякую свою причастность к этому делу. По его словам, у него нет
ни малейшего представления о том, чем вообще занимается его жилец, Хью Бун. Появление в комнате одежды пропавшего джентльмена – для него полнейшая загадка.
Вот все, что известно о хозяине-ласкаре. Теперь обратимся к угрюмому калеке, который живет
во втором этаже над притоном и безусловно является последним человеком, видевшим Невилла
Сент-Клера. Его зовут Хью Бун, и его безобразное лицо хорошо знает всякий, кому приходится часто
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
бывать в Сити. Он профессиональный нищий; впрочем, для того чтобы обойти полицейские правила,
он делает вид, будто продает восковые спички.
He is a professional beggar.
Как вы, вероятно, не раз замечали, на левой стороне Трэд-Нидл-стрит есть ниша. В этой нише
сидит калека, поджав ноги и разложив у себя на коленях несколько спичечных коробков; вид его вызывает сострадание, и дождь милостыни так и льется в грязную кожаную кепку, которая лежит перед
ним на мостовой. Я не раз наблюдал за ним, еще не предполагая, что нам когда-нибудь придется познакомиться с ним, как с преступником, и всегда удивлялся тому, какую обильную жатву он собирает в самое короткое время. У него такая незаурядная внешность, что никто не может пройти мимо, не
обратив на него внимания. Оранжево-рыжие волосы, бледное лицо, изуродованное чудовищным
шрамом, нижний конец которого рассек надвое верхнюю губу, бульдожий подбородок и проницательные темные глаза, цвет которых представляет такой резкий контраст с цветом его волос, – все
это выделяет его из серой толпы попрошаек. У него всегда наготове едкая шутка для каждого, кто,
проходя мимо, попытается задеть его насмешливым словом.
Таков обитатель верхнего этажа этой подозрительней курильни… После него никто уже не видел джентльмена, которого мы разыскиваем.
– Но ведь он калека! – сказал я. – Как мог он один совладать с сильным, мускулистым молодым
человеком?
– У него искалечена только нога, и он слегка прихрамывает на ходу, вообще же он здоровяк и
силач. Вы, Уотсон, как медик, конечно, знаете, что часто слабость одной конечности возмещается
необычайной силой других.
– Пожалуйста, рассказывайте дальше.
– При виде крови на подоконнике миссис Сент-Клер стало дурно, и ее отправили домой в сопровождении полицейского, тем более что для дальнейшего расследования ее присутствие не было
необходимо. Инспектор Бартон, принявший на себя ведение этого дела, тщательно обыскал весь притон, но не нашел ничего нового. Сделали ошибку: не арестовали Буна в первую же минуту и тем самым предоставили ему возможность в течение нескольких минут обменяться двумя-тремя словами
со своим другом, ласкаром. Однако ошибка эта была скоро исправлена: Буна схватили и обыскали.
Но обыск не дал никаких улик против него. Правда, на правом рукаве его рубашки оказались следы
крови, но он показал полицейским свой безымянный палец, на котором был порез возле самого ногтя, и прибавил, что следы крови на подоконнике, вероятно, являются следствием того же пореза, так
как он подходил к окну, когда у него из пальца шла кровь. Он упорно утверждал, что никогда не видел мистера Сент-Клера, и клялся, что присутствие одежды этого джентльмена у него в комнате –
такая же тайна для него, как и для полиции. А когда ему передали, что миссис Сент-Клер видела своего мужа в окне его комнаты, он сказал, что это ей либо почудилось в припадке безумия, либо просто
приснилось. Буна отвели в участок. Он громко протестовал. Инспектор остался поджидать отлива,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
надеясь обнаружить на дне капала какие-нибудь новые улики. И действительно, в липкой грязи, на
самом дне, нашли кое-что, но совсем не то, что они с таким страхом ожидали найти. Когда отхлынула вода, они обнаружили в канале не самого Невилла Сент-Клера, а лишь пиджак Heвилла СентКлера. И как вы думаете, что они нашли в карманах пиджака?
– Представить себе не могу.
– Я и не думаю, чтобы вы могли угадать. Все карманы были набиты монетами в пенни и в полпенни – четыреста двадцать одно пенни и двести семьдесят полпенни. Неудивительно, что отлив не
унес пиджака. А вот труп – дело другое. Между домом и верфью очень сильное течение. Вполне допустимо, что труп был унесен в реку, в то время как тяжеловесный пиджак остался на дне.
– Но, если не ошибаюсь, всю остальную одежду нашли в комнате. Неужели на трупе был один
лишь пиджак?
– Нет, сэр, но этому можно найти объяснение. Предположим, что Бун выбросил Невилла СентКлера через окно и этого никто не видел. Что стал бы он делать дальше? Естественно, что первым
долгом он попытался бы избавиться от одежды, которая могла его выдать. Он берет пиджак, хочет
выбросить его за окно, но тут ему приходит в голову, что пиджак не потонет, а поплывет. Он страшно торопится, ибо слышит суматоху на лестнице, слышит, как жена Сент-Клера требует, чтобы ее
пустили к мужу, да вдобавок, быть может, его сообщник ласкар предупреждает его о приближении
полиции. Нельзя терять ни минуты. Он кидается в укромный угол, где спрятаны плоды его нищенства, и набивает карманы пиджака первыми попавшимися под руку монетами. Затем он выбрасывает
пиджак и хочет выбросить остальные вещи, но слышит шум шагов на лестнице и перед появлением
полиции едва успевает захлопнуть окно.
He stuffs all the coins into the pockets.
– Это правдоподобно.
– Примем это как рабочую гипотезу, за неимением лучшего… Бун, как я вам уже говорил, был
арестован и приведен в участок. Прежняя его жизнь, в сущности, безупречяа. Правда, в продолжение
многих лет он был известен как профессиональный нищий, но жил спокойно и ни в чем дурном замечен не был.
Вот в каком положении находится все это дело в настоящее время. Как видите, по– прежнему
остаются нерешенными вопросы о том, что делал Невилл Сент-Клер в этой курильне опия, что там с
ним случилось, где он теперь и какое отношение имеет Хью Бун к его исчезновению. Должен признаться, что не помню случая в моей практике, который на первый взгляд казался бы таким простым
и был бы в действительности таким трудным.
Пока Шерлок Холмс рассказывал мне подробности этих удивительных происшествий, мы ми-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
новали предместье огромного города, оставили позади последние дома и покатили по дороге, с обеих
сторон которой тянулись деревенские плетни. Как раз к тому времени, как мы очутились в деревне,
весь его рассказ был закончен. Кое-где в окнах мерцали огни.
– Мы въезжаем в Ли, – сказал мой приятель. – За время нашего небольшого путешествия мы
побывали в трех графствах Англии: выехали из Миддлсекса, пересекли угол Сэрри и приехали в
Кент. Видите те огоньки между деревьями? Это «Кедры». Там возле лампы сидит женщина, настороженный слух которой несомненно уже уловил стук копыт нашей лошади.
– Отчего, ведя это дело, вы живете тут, а не на Бейкер-стрит? – спросил я.
– Оттого, что многое приходится расследовать здесь… Миссис Сент-Клер любезно предоставила в мое распоряжение две комнаты, и можете быть уверены, что она будет рада оказать гостеприимство моему другу, помогающему мне в моих розысках. О, как тяжело мне встречаться с ней, Уотсон,
пока я не могу сообщить ей ничего нового о ее муже! Приехали! Тпру!..
Мы остановились перед большой виллой, окруженной садом. Передав лошадь выбежавшему
нам навстречу конюху, мы с Холмсом пошли к дому по узенькой дорожке, посыпанной гравием. При
нашем приближении дверь распахнулась, и у порога появилась маленькая белокурая женщина в
светлом шелковом платье с отделкой из пышного розового шифона. Одной рукой она держалась за
дверь, а другую подняла в нетерпении; нагнувшись вперед, полураскрыв губы, жадно глядя на нас,
она, казалось, всем своим обликом спрашивала, что нового мы ей привезли.
– Ну? – громко спросила она.
Заметив, что нас двое, она радостно вскрикнула, но крик этот превратился в стон, когда товарищ мой покачал головой и пожал плечами.
– Узнали что-нибудь хорошее?
– Нет.
– А дурное?
– Тоже нет.
– И то слава богу. Но входите же. У вас был трудный день, вы, наверно, устали.
– Это мой друг, доктор Уотсон. Он был чрезвычайно полезен мне во многих моих расследованиях, и, по счастливой случайности, мне удалось привезти его сюда, чтобы воспользоваться его помощью в наших поисках.
– Рада вас видеть, – сказал она, приветливо пожимая мне руку. – Боюсь, что вам покажется у
нас неуютно. Ведь вы знаете, какой удар внезапно обрушился на нашу семью…
– Сударыня, – сказал я, – я отставной солдат, привыкший к походной жизни, но, право, если бы
даже я не был солдатом, вам не в чем было бы извиняться передо мною. Буду счастлив, если мне
удастся принести пользу вам или моему другу.
– Мистер Шерлок Холмс, – сказала она, вводя нас в ярко освещенную столовую, где нас поджидал холодный ужин, – я хочу задать вам несколько откровенных вопросов и прошу вас ответить на
них так же прямо и откровенно.
– Извольте, сударыня.
– Не щадите моих чувств. Со мной не бывает ни истерик, ни обмороков. Я хочу знать ваше настоящее, подлинное мнение.
– О чем?
– Верите ли вы в глубине души, что Невилл жив?
Шерлок Холмс, видимо, был смущен этим вопросом.
– Говорите откровенно, – повторила она, стоя на ковре и пристально глядя Холмсу в лицо.
– Говоря откровенно, сударыня, не верю.
– Вы думаете, что он умер?
– Да, думаю.
– Убит?
– Я этого не утверждаю.
– В какой же день он умер?
– В понедельник.
– В таком случае, мистер Холмс, будьте любезны объяснить мне, каким образом я могла получить от него сегодня это письмо?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Frankly, now!» she repeated.
Шерлок Холмс вскочил с кресла, словно его ударило электрическим током.
– Что? – закричал он.
– Да, сегодня.
Она улыбалась, держа в руке листок бумаги.
– Можно прочитать?
– Пожалуйста.
Он выхватил письмо у нее из рук, разложил его на столе, разгладил и принялся внимательно
рассматривать. Я поднялся с кресла и стал смотреть через его плечо. Конверт был простой, конторский; на конверте стоял почтовый штемпель Гревзенда; на штемпеле – сегодняшнее или, вернее, вчерашнее число, так как полночь уже миновала.
– Грубый почерк, – пробормотал Холмс. – Уверен, что это почерк не вашего мужа, сударыня.
– Да, на конверте чужой почерк, но внутри – почерк моего мужа.
– Человеку, который надписывал конверт, пришлось наводить справки о вашем адресе.
– Откуда вы это знаете?
– Имя на конверте, как видите, выделяется своей чернотой, потому что чернила, которыми оно
написано, высохли сами собою. Адрес же бледноват, потому что к нему прикладывали пресс-папье.
Если бы надпись на конверте была сделана сразу и если бы ее всю высушили пресс-папье, все слова
были бы одинаково серы. Этот человек написал на конверте сперва только ваше имя и лишь спустя
некоторое время приписал к нему адрес, из чего можно заключить, что адрес не был ему вначале известен. Конечно, это пустяк, но в моей профессии нет ничего важнее пустяков. Дайте мне взглянуть
на письмо… Ага! Туда было что-то вложено.
– Да, там было кольцо. Его кольцо с печатью.
– А вы уверены, что это почерк вашего мужа?
– Один из его почерков.
– Один из его почерков?
– Его почерк, когда он пишет второпях. Обычно он пишет совсем иначе, но и этот его почерк
мне хорошо знаком.
– «Дорогая, не волнуйся. Все кончится хорошо. Произошла ошибка, на исправление которой
требуется некоторое время. Жди терпеливо. Невилл»… Написано карандашом на листке, вырванном
из блокнота. Гм! Отправлено сегодня из Гревзенда человеком, у которого большой палец чем-то выпачкан. Ха! Если не ошибаюсь, человек, заклеивавший конверт, жует табак… Вы убеждены, сударыня, что это почерк вашего мужа?
– Убеждена. Это письмо написал Невилл.
– Оно отправлено сегодня из Гревзенда. Что ж, миссис Сент-Клер, тучи рассеиваются, хотя я не
могу сказать, что опасность уже миновала.
– Однако он жив, мистер Холмс!
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Если только это не ловкая подделка, чтобы направить нас на ложный след. Кольцо, в конце
концов, ничего не доказывает. Кольцо могли отнять у него.
– Но это его, его, его почерк!
– Хорошо. Но что, если письмо написано в понедельник, а послано только сегодня?
– Это возможно.
– А за этот срок многое могло произойти.
– О, не отнимайте у меня моей радости, мистер Холмс! Я знаю, что с ним ничего не случилось.
Мы с ним настолько близки, что я непременно почувствовала бы, если бы он попал в настоящую беду. За день до того, как он исчез, он порезал себе нечаянно палец. Я была в столовой, он – в спальне,
и я сразу побежала к нему, чувствуя, что с ним случилась беда. Неужели вы думаете, что я не знала
бы о его смерти, если даже такой пустяк способен повлиять на меня!
– Я человек опытный и знаю, что женское непосредственное чутье может быть иногда ценнее
всяких логических выводов. И это письмо, конечно, служит важным указанием, что вы правы. Однако, если мистер Сент-Клер жив, если он может писать вам письма, отчего же он не с вами?
– Не знаю. И представить себе не могу.
– В понедельник, уезжая, он ни о чем вас не предупреждал?
– Нет.
– И вы очень удивились, увидев его на Суондем-лейн?
– Очень.
– Окно было открыто?
– Да.
– Он мог бы окликнуть вас из окна?
– Да.
– Между тем, насколько я понял, у него вырвалось только бессвязное восклицание?
– Да.
– Вы подумали, что он зовет вас на помощь?
– Да. Он махнул мне руками.
– Но, быть может, он вскрикнул от неожиданности. Он мог всплеснуть руками от изумления,
что видит вас.
– Возможно.
– И вам показалось, что его оттащили от окна?
– Он исчез так внезапно…
– Он мог просто отскочить от окна. Вы никого больше не видели в комнате?
– Никого. Но ведь этот отвратительный нищий сам признался, что Невилл был там. А лаокар
стоял внизу, у лестницы.
– Совершенно верно. Насколько вы могли разглядеть, ваш муж был одет, как всегда?
– Но на нем не было ни воротничка, ни галстука. Я отчетливо видела его голую шею.
– Он когда-нибудь говорил с вами о Суондем-лейн?
– Никогда.
– А вы никогда не замечали каких-нибудь признаков, указывающих на то, что он курит опий?
– Никогда.
– Благодарю вас, миссис Сент-Клер. Это основные пункты, о которых я хотел знать всё. Теперь
мы поужинаем и пойдем отдохнуть, так как весьма возможно, что завтра нам предстоит много хлопот.
В наше распоряжение была предоставлена просторная, удобная комната с двумя кроватями, и я
сразу улегся, так как ночные похождения утомили меня. Но Шерлок Холмс, когда у него была какаянибудь нерешенная задача, мог не спать по целым суткам и даже неделям, обдумывая ее, сопоставляя
факты, рассматривая ее с разных точек зрения до тех пор, пока ему не удавалось либо разрешить ее,
либо убедиться, что он, находится на ложном пути. Я скоро понял, что он готовится просидеть без
сна всю ночь. Он снял пиджак и жилет, надел синий просторный халат и принялся собирать в одну
кучу подушки с кровати, с кушетки и с кресел. Из этих подушек он соорудил себе нечто вроде восточного дивана и взгромоздился на него, поджав ноги и положив перед собой пачку табаку и коробок
спичек. При тусклом свете лампы я видел, как он сидит там в облаках голубого дыма, со старой
трубкой во рту, рассеянно устремив глаза в потолок, безмолвный, неподвижный, и свет озаряет резкие орлиные черты его лица.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Так сидел он, когда я засыпал, и так сидел он, когда я при блеске утреннего солнца открыл глаза, разбуженный его внезапным восклицанием. Трубка все еще торчала у него изо рта, дым все еще
вился кверху, комната была полна табачного тумана, а от пачки табаку, которую я видел вечером,
уже ничего не осталось.
The pipe was still between his lips.
– Проснулись, Уотсон? – спросил он.
– Да.
– Хотите прокатиться?
– С удовольствием.
– Так одевайтесь. В доме еще все спят, но я знаю, где ночует конюх, и сейчас у нас будет коляска.
При этих словах он усмехнулся; глаза его блестели, и он нисколько не был похож на того мрачного мыслителя, которого я видел ночью.
Одеваясь, я взглянул на часы. Неудивительно, что в доме все еще спали: было двадцать пять
минут пятого. Едва я успел одеться, как вошел Холмс и сказал, что конюх уже запряг лошадь.
– Хочу проверить одну свою версию, – сказал он, надевая ботинки. – Вы, Уотсон, видите перед
собой одного из величайших глупцов, какие только существуют в Европе! Я был слеп, как крот. Мне
следовало бы дать такого тумака, чтобы я полетел отсюда до Черинг-кросса! Но теперь я, кажется,
нашел ключ к этой загадке.
– Где же он, ваш ключ? – спросил я, улыбаясь.
– В ванной, – ответил Холмс. – Нет, я не шучу, – продолжал он, заметив мой недоверчивый
взгляд. – Я уже был в ванной, взял его и спрятал вот сюда, в чемоданчик. Поедем, друг мой, и посмотрим, подойдет ли этот ключ к замку.
Мы спустились с лестницы, стараясь ступать как можно тише. На дворе уже ярко сияло утреннее солнце У ворот нас поджидала коляска; конюх держал под уздцы запряженную лошадь.
Мы вскочили в экипаж и быстро покатили по лондонской дороге. Изредка мы обгоняли телеги,
которые везли в столицу овощи, но на виллах кругом все было тихо – все спало, как в заколдованном
городе.
– В некоторых отношениях это совершенно исключительное дело, – сказал Холмс, пуская лошадь галопом. – Сознаюсь, я был слеп, как крот, но лучше поумнеть поздно, чем никогда.
Мы въехали в город со стороны Сэрри. В окнах уже начали появляться заспанные лица только
что проснувшихся людей. Мы переехали через реку по мосту Ватерлоо, свернули направо по Веллингтон-стрит и очутились на Бау-стрит. Шерлока Холмса хорошо знали в полицейском управлении,
и, когда мы подъехали, два констебля отдали ему честь. Один из них взял лошадь под уздцы, а другой повел нас внутрь здания.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Кто дежурный? – спросил Холмс.
– Инспектор Брэдстрит, сэр.
Из вымощенного каменными плитами коридора навстречу нам вышел высокий грузный полицейский в полной форме.
– А, Брэдстрит! Как поживаете? Я хочу поговорить с вами, Брэдстрит.
– Пожалуйста, мистер Холмс. Зайдите ко мне, в мою комнату.
Комната была похожа на контору: на столе огромная книга для записей, на стене телефон.
Инспектор сел за стол:
– Чем могу служить, мистер Холмс?
– Я хочу расспросить вас о том нищем, который замешан в деле исчезновения мистера Невилла
Сент-Клера.
– Его арестовали и привезли сюда для допроса.
– Я знаю. Он здесь?
– В камере.
– Не буйствует?
– Нет, ведет себя тихо. Но как он грязен, этот негодяй!
– Грязен?
– Да. Еле-еле заставили его вымыть руки, а лицо у него черное, как у медника. Вот пусть только
кончится следствие, а там уж ему не избежать тюремной ванны! Если бы вы на него посмотрели, вы
согласились бы со мною.
– Я очень хотел бы на него посмотреть.
– Правда? Это нетрудно устроить. Идите за мной.
Чемоданчик свой можете оставить здесь.
– Нет, я захвачу его с собой.
– Хорошо. Пожалуйте сюда.
Он открыл запертую дверь, спустился по винтовой лестнице и привел нас в коридор с выбеленными стенами. Справа и слева шла вереница дверей.
– Его камера – третья справа, – сказал инспектор. – Вот здесь.
Он осторожно отодвинул дощечку в верхней части двери и глянул в отверстие.
– Спит, – сказал он. – Вы можете хорошенько его рассмотреть.
Мы оба приникли к решетке. Арестант крепко спал, медленно и тяжело дыша. Лицо его было
обращено к нам. Это был мужчина среднего роста, одетый, как и подобает людям его профессии,
очень скверно: сквозь прорехи порванного пиджака торчали лохмотья цветной рубахи. Он был действительно необычайно грязен, но даже толстый слой грязи, покрывавший лицо, не мог скрыть его
отталкивающего безобразия. Широкий шрам шел от глаза к подбородку, и сквозь щель, прорубленную к верхней губе, постоянным оскалом торчали три зуба. Клок ярчайших рыжих волос падал на
лоб и на глаза.
– Красавец, не правда ли? – сказал инспектор.
– Ему необходимо помыться, – заметил Холмс. – Я уже и раньше об этом догадывался и захватил с собой весь инструмент.
Он раскрыл чемоданчик и, к нашему изумлению, вынул из него большую губку.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He took out a very large bath-sponge.
– Хе-хе, да вы шутник! – засмеялся инспектор.
– Будьте любезны, откройте нам тихонько дверь, и мы живо придадим ему более приличный
вид.
– Ладно, – оказал инспектор. – А то он и в самом деле позорит нашу тюрьму.
Инспектор открыл дверь, и мы втроем бесшумно вошли в камеру. Арестант шевельнулся, но
сразу же заснул еще крепче. Холмс подошел к рукомойнику, намочил свою губку и дважды с силой
провел ею по лицу арестанта.
– Позвольте мне представить вас мистеру Невиллу Сент-Клеру из Ли, в графстве Кент! – воскликнул Холмс.
Никогда в жизни не видел я ничего подобного. Лицо сползло с арестанта, как кора с дерева.
Исчез грубый темный загар. Исчез ужасный шрам, пересекавший все лицо наискосок. Исчезла разрезанная губа. Исчез отталкивающий оскал зубов. Рыжие лохматые волосы исчезли от одного взмаха
руки Холмса, и мы увидели бледного, грустного, изящного человека с черными волосами и нежной
кожей, который, сидя в постели, протирал глаза и с недоумением глядел на нас, еще не вполне очнувшись от сна. Внезапно он понял все, вскрикнул и зарылся головой в подушку.
He broke into a scream.
– Боже, – закричал инспектор, – да ведь это и есть пропавший! Я знаю его, я видел фотогра-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
фию!
Арестант повернулся к нам с безнадежным видом человека, решившего не противиться судьбе.
– Будь что будет! – сказал он. – За что вы меня держите здесь?
– За убийство мистера Невилла Сент… Тьфу! В убийстве вас теперь обвинить невозможно. Вас
могли бы обвинить, пожалуй, только в попытке совершить самоубийство, – сказал инспектор, усмехаясь. – Я двадцать семь лет служу в полиции, но ничего подобного не видел.
– Раз я мистер Невилл Сент-Клер, то, значит, преступления совершено не было и, следовательно, я арестован незаконно.
– Преступления нет, но сделана большая ошибка, – сказал Холмс. – Вы напрасно не доверились
жене.
– Дело не в жене, а в детях, – пылко сказал арестант. – Я не хотел, чтобы они стыдились отца.
Боже, какой позор! Что мне делать?
Шерлок Холмс сел рядом с ним на койку и ласково похлопал его по плечу.
– Если вы позволите разбираться в вашем деле суду, вам, конечно, не избежать огласки, – оказал он. – Но если вам удастся убедить полицию, что за вами нет никакой вины, газеты ничего не узнают. Инспектор Брэдстрит может записать ваши показания и передать их надлежащим властям, и
дело до суда не дойдет.
– О, как я вам благодарен! – вскричал арестант. – Я охотно перенес бы заточение, даже смертную казнь, лишь бы не опозорить детей раскрытием моей несчастной тайны! Вы первые услышите
мою историю…
Отец мой был учителем в Честерфилде, и я получил там превосходное образование. В юности я
много путешествовал, работал на сцене и, наконец, стал репортером одной вечерней лондонской газеты. Однажды моему редактору понадобилась серия очерков о нищенстве в столице, и я вызвался
написать их. С этого и начались все мои приключения. Чтобы добыть необходимые для моих очерков
факты, я решил переодеться нищим и стал попрошайничать. Когда я был еще актером, я славился
умением гримироваться. Теперь это умение пригодилось. Я раскрасил себе лицо, а для того чтобы
вызывать побольше жалости, намалевал на лице шрам и с помощью пластыря телесного цвета изуродовал себе губу, слегка приподняв ее. Затем, надев лохмотья и.рыжий парик, я сел в самом оживленном месте Сити и принялся под видом продажи спичек просить милостыню. Семь часов я просидел
не вставая, а вечером, вернувшись домой, к величайшему своему изумлению, обнаружил, что набрал
двадцать шесть шиллингов и четыре пенса.
Я написал очерки и позабыл обо всей этой истории. Но вот, некоторое время спустя, мне
предъявили вексель, по которому я поручился уплатить за приятеля двадцать пять фунтов. Я понятия
не имел, где достать эти деньги, и вдруг мне в голову пришла отличная мысль. Упросив кредитора
подождать две недели, я взял на работе отпуск и провел его в Сити, прося милостыню. За десять дней
я собрал необходимую сумму и уплатил долг. Теперь вообразите себе, легко ли работать за два фунта
в неделю, когда знаешь, что эти два фунта ты можешь получить в один день, выпачкав себе лицо, положив кепку на землю и ровно ничего не делая?
Долго длилась борьба между моей гордостью в стремлением к наживе, но страсть к деньгам в
конце концов победила. Я бросил работу и стал все дни проводить на давно облюбованном мною углу, вызывая жалость своим уродливым видом и набивая карманы медяками.
Только один человек был посвящен в мою тайну – владелец низкопробного притона на Суондем-лейн, в котором я поселился. Каждое утро я выходил оттуда в виде жалкого нищего, и каждый
вечер я превращался там в хорошо одетого господина, я щедро платил этому ласкару за его комнаты,
так как был уверен, что он никому ни при каких обстоятельствах не выдаст моей тайны.
Вскоре я стал откладывать крупные суммы денег. Вряд ли в Лондоне есть хоть один нищий, зарабатывающий по семисот фунтов в год, а я зарабатывал и больше. Я навострился шуткой парировать замечания прохожих и скоро прославился на все Сити. Поток пенсов вперемешку с серебром
сыпался на меня непрестанно, и я считал неудачными дни, когда получал меньше двух фунтов. Чем
богаче я становился, тем шире я жил. Я снял дом за городом, я женился, и никто не подозревал, чем я
занимаюсь в действительности. Моя милая жена знает, что у меня есть какие-то дела в Сити. Но какого рода эти дела, она не имеет ни малейшего представления.
В прошлый понедельник, закончив работу, я переодевался у себя в комнате, как вдруг, выглянув в окно, увидел, к своему ужасу, что жена моя стоит на улице и смотрит прямо на меня. Я вскрикнул от изумления, поднял руки, чтобы закрыть лицо, и кинулся к моему соучастнику ласкару, умоляя
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
его никого ко мне не пускать. Я слышал внизу голос жены, но я знал, что подняться она не сможет. Я
быстро разделся, натянул на себя нищенские лохмотья, парик и разрисовал лицо. Даже жена не могла
бы узнать меня в этом виде.
Но затем мне пришло в голову, что комнату мою могут обыскать и тогда моя одежда выдаст
меня. Я распахнул окно, причем второпях задел раненый палец (я поранил себе палец утром в спальне), и из ранки опять потекла кровь. Потом я схватил пиджак, набитый медяками, которые я только
что переложил туда из своей нищенской сумы, швырнул его в окно, и он исчез в Темзе. Я собирался
швырнуть туда и остальную одежду, но тут ко мне ворвались полицейские и через несколько минут,
вместо того чтобы быть изобличенным как мистер Невилл Сент-Клер, я оказался арестованным как
его убийца.
Больше мне нечего прибавить. Желая сохранить грим на лице, я отказывался от умывания.
Зная, что жена будет очень тревожиться обо мне, я тайком от полицейских снял с пальца кольцо и
передал его ласкару вместе с наскоро нацарапанной запиской, в которой я сообщал ей, что мне не угрожает никакая опасность.
– Она только вчера получила эту записку, – сказал Холмс.
– О боже! Какую неделю она провела!
– За ласкаром следила полиция, – сказал инспектор Брэдстрит, – и ему, видимо, никак не удавалось отправить записку незаметно. Он, вероятно, передал ее какому-нибудь матросу, завсегдатаю
своего притона, а тот в течение нескольких дней все забывал опустить ее в ящик.
– Так это, без сомнения и было, – подтвердил Холмс. – Но неужели вас никогда не привлекали
к суду за нищенство?
– Много раз. Но что значит для меня незначительный штраф!
– Однако теперь вам придется оставить свое ремесло, – сказал Брэдстрит. – Если вы хотите,
чтобы полиция замяла эту историю, Хью Бун должен исчезнуть.
– Я уже поклялся себе в этом самой торжественной клятвой, какую только может дать человек.
– В таком случае, все будет забыто, – сказал Брэдстрит. – Но если вас заметят опять, мы уже не
станем скрывать ничего… Мы очень признательны вам, мистер Холмс, за то, что вы раскрыли это
дело. Хотел бы я знать, каким образом вы достигаете подобных результатов.
– На этот раз, – отозвался мой друг, – мне понадобилось посидеть на пяти подушках и выкурить
полфунта табаку… Мне кажется, Уотсон, что, если мы сейчас поедем на Бейкер-стрит, мы поспеем
как раз к завтраку.

На третий день Рождества зашел я к Шерлоку Холмсу, чтобы поздравить его с праздником. Он
лежал на кушетке в красном халате; по правую руку от него была подставка для трубок, а по левую –
груда помятых утренних газет которые он, видимо, только что просматривал. Рядом с кушеткой стоял стул, на его спинке висела сильно поношенная, потерявшая вид фетровая шляпа. Холмс, должно
быть очень внимательно изучал эту шляпу, так как тут же на сиденье стула лежали пинцет и лупа.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
A very seedy hard-felt hat.
– Вы заняты? – сказал я. – Я вам не помешал?
– Нисколько, – ответил он. – Я рад, что у меня есть друг, с которым я могу обсудить результаты
некоторых моих изысканий. Дельце весьма заурядное, но с этой вещью, – он ткнул большим пальцем
в сторону шляпы, – связаны кое-какие любопытные и даже поучительные события.
Я уселся в кресло и стал греть руки у камина, где потрескивал огонь. Был сильный мороз; окна
покрылись плотными ледяными узорами.
– Хотя эта шляпа кажется очень невзрачной, она, должно быть, связана с какой-нибудь кровавой историей, – заметил я.
– Очевидно, она послужит ключом к разгадке страшной тайны, и благодаря ей вам удастся изобличить и наказать преступника.
– Нет, – засмеялся Шерлок Холмс, – тут не преступление, а мелкий, смешной эпизод, который
всегда может произойти там, где четыре миллиона человек толкутся на площади в несколько квадратных миль. В таком колоссальном человеческом улье возможны любые комбинации событий и
фактов, возникает масса незначительных, но загадочных и странных происшествий, хотя ничего преступного в них нет. Нам уже приходилось сталкиваться с подобными случаями.
– Еще бы! – воскликнул я. – Из последних шести эпизодов, которыми я пополнил свои записки,
три не содержат ничего беззаконного.
– Совершенно верно. Вы имеете в виду мои попытки обнаружить бумаги Ирен Адлер, интересный случай с мисс Мэри Сазерлэнд и приключения человека с рассеченной губой. Не сомневаюсь,
что и это дело окажется столь же невинным. Вы знаете Питерсона, посыльного?
– Да.
– Этот трофей принадлежит ему.
– Это его шляпа?
– Нет, он нашел ее. Владелец ее неизвестен. Я прошу вас рассматривать эту шляпу не как старую рухлядь, а как предмет, таящий в себе серьезную задачу… Однако прежде всего, как эта шляпа
попала сюда. Она появилась в первый день Рождества вместе с отличным жирным гусем, который в
данный момент наверняка жарится у Питерсона в кухне. Произошло это так. На Рождество, в четыре
часа утра, Питерсон, человек, как вы знаете, благородный и честный, возвращался с пирушки домой
по улице Тоттенхем-Корт– роуд. При свете газового фонаря он заметил, что перед ним, слегка пошатываясь, идет какой-то субъект и несет на плече белоснежного гуся. На углу Гудж-стрит к незнакомцу пристали хулиганы. Один из них сбил с него шляпу, а незнакомец, отбиваясь, размахнулся палкой
и попал в витрину магазина, оказавшуюся у него за спиной. Питерсон кинулся вперед, чтобы защитить его, но тот, испуганный тем, что разбил стекло, увидев бегущего к нему человека, бросил гуся,
помчался со всех ног и исчез в лабиринте небольших переулков, лежащих позади Тоттенхем-Кортроуд. Питерсон был в форме, и это, должно быть, больше всего и напугало беглеца. Хулиганы тоже
разбежались, и посыльный остался один на поле битвы, оказавшись обладателем этой понятой шляпы и превосходного рождественского гуся…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
The roughs had flet at the appearance of Peterson.
–…которого Питерсон, конечно, возвратил незнакомцу?
– В том-то и загвоздка, дорогой друг. Правда, на карточке, привязанной к левой лапке гуся, было написано: «Для миссис Генри Бейкер», а на подкладке шляпы можно разобрать инициалы «Г. Б.».
Но в Лондоне живет несколько тысяч Бейкеров и несколько сот Генри Бейкеров, так что нелегко вернуть потерянную собственность одному из них.
– Что же сделал Питерсон?
– Зная, что меня занимает решение даже самых ничтожных загадок, он попросту принес мне и
гуся и шляпу. Гуся мы продержали вплоть до сегодняшнего утра, когда стало ясно, что, несмотря на
мороз, его все же лучше незамедлительно съесть. Питерсон унес гуся, и с гусем произошло то, к чему
он уготован судьбой, а у меня осталась шляпа незнакомца, потерявшего свой рождественский ужин.
– Он не помещал объявления в газете?
– Нет.
– Как же вы узнаете, кто он?
– Только путем размышлений.
– Размышлений над этой шляпой?
– Конечно.
– Вы шутите! Что можно извлечь из этого старого рваного фетра?
– Вот лупа. Попробуйте применить мой метод. Что вы можете сказать о человеке, которому
принадлежала эта шляпа?
Я взял рваную шляпу и уныло повертел ее в руках. Самая обыкновенная черная круглая шляпа,
жесткая, сильно поношенная. Шелковая подкладка, некогда красная, теперь выцвела. Фабричную
марку мне обнаружить не удалось, но, как и сказал Холмс, внутри сбоку виднелись инициалы «Г. Б.».
На полях я заметил петельку для придерживавшей шляпу резинки, но самой резинки не оказалось.
Вообще шляпа была мятая, грязная, покрытая пятнами. Впрочем, заметны были попытки замазать
эти пятна чернилами.
– Я ничего в ней не вижу, – сказал я, возвращая шляпу Шерлоку Холмсу.
– Нет, Уотсон, видите, но не даете себе труда поразмыслить над тем, что видите. Вы слишком
робки в своих логических выводах.
– Тогда, пожалуйста, скажите, какие же выводы делаете вы?
Холмс взял шляпу в руки и стал пристально разглядывать ее проницательным взглядом, свойственным ему одному.
– Конечно, не все достаточно ясно, – заметил он, – но кое-что можно установить наверняка, а
кое-что предположить с разумной долей вероятия. Совершенно очевидно, например, что владелец ее
– человек большого ума и что три года назад у него были изрядные деньги, а теперь настали черные
дни. Он всегда был предусмотрителен и заботился о завтрашнем дне, но мало-помалу опустился,
благосостояние его упало, и мы вправе предположить, что он пристрастился к какому-нибудь поро-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ку, – быть может, к пьянству. По-видимому, из-за этого и жена его разлюбила…
– Дорогой Холмс…
– Но в какой-то степени он еще сохранил свое достоинство, – продолжал Холмс, не обращая
внимания на мое восклицание. – Он ведет сидячий образ жизни, редко выходит из дому, совершенно
не занимается спортом. Этот человек средних лет, у него седые волосы, он мажет их помадой и недавно подстригся. Вдобавок я почти уверен, что в доме у него нет газового освещения.
– Вы, конечно, шутите, Холмс.
– Ничуть. Неужели даже теперь, когда я все рассказал, вы не понимаете, как я узнал об этом?
– Считайте меня идиотом, но должен признаться, что я не в состоянии уследить за ходом ваших
мыслей. Например, откуда вы взяли, что он умен?
Вместо ответа Холмс нахлобучил шляпу себе на голову. Шляпа закрыла его лоб и уперлась в
переносицу.
– Видите, какой размер! – сказал он. – Не может же быть совершенно пустым такой большой
череп.
– Ну, а откуда вы взяли, что он обеднел?
– Этой шляпе три года. Тогда были модными плоские поля, загнутые по краям. Шляпа лучшего
качества. Взгляните-ка на эту шелковую ленту, на превосходную подкладку. Если три года назад человек был в состоянии купить столь дорогую шляпу и с тех пор не покупал ни одной, значит, дела у
него пошатнулись.
– Ну ладно, в этом, пожалуй, вы правы. Но откуда вы могли узнать, что он человек предусмотрительный, а в настоящее время переживает душевный упадок?
– Предусмотрительность – вот она, – сказал он, показывая на петельку от шляпной резинки. –
Резинки не продают вместе со шляпой, их нужно покупать отдельно. Раз этот человек купил резинку
и велел прикрепить к шляпе, значит, он заботился о том, чтобы уберечь ее от ветра. Но когда резинка
оторвалась, а он не стал прилаживать новую, это значит, что он перестал следить за своей наружностью, опустился. Однако, с другой стороны, он пытался замазать чернилами пятна на шляпе, то есть
не окончательно потерял чувство собственного достоинства.
– Все это очень похоже на правду.
– Что он человек средних лет, что у него седина, что он недавно стригся, что он помадит волосы – все станет ясным, если внимательно посмотреть на нижнюю часть подкладки в шляпе. В лупу
видны приставшие к подкладке волосы, аккуратно срезанные ножницами парикмахера и пахнущие
помадой. Заметьте, что пыль на шляпе не уличная – серая и жесткая, а домашняя – бурая, пушистая.
Значит, шляпа большей частью висела дома. А следы влажности на внутренней ее стороне говорят о
том, как быстро потеет ее владелец, потому что не привык много двигаться.
– А как вы узнали, что его разлюбила жена?
– Шляпа не чищена несколько недель. Мой дорогой Уотсон, если бы я увидел, что ваша шляпа
не чищена хотя бы неделю и вам позволяют выходить в таком виде, у меня появилось бы опасение,
что вы имели несчастье утратить расположение вашей супруги.
– А может быть, он холостяк?
– Нет, он нес гуся именно для того, чтобы задобрить жену. Вспомните карточку, привязанную к
лапке птицы.
– У вас на все готов ответ. Но откуда вы знаете, что у него в доме нет газа?
– Одно-два сальных пятна на шляпе – случайность. Но когда я вижу их не меньше пяти, я не
сомневаюсь, что человеку часто приходится пользоваться сальной свечой, может быть, он поднимается ночью по лестнице, держа в одной руке шляпу, а в другой оплывшую свечу. Во всяком случае,
от газа не бывает сальных пятен… Вы согласны со мною?
– Да, все это очень остроумно, – смеясь, сказал я. – Но, как вы сами сказали, тут еще нет преступления. Никто не пострадал – разве что человек, потерявший гуся, – значит, вы ломали себе голову зря.
Шерлок Холмс раскрыл было рот для ответа, но в это мгновение дверь распахнулась, и в комнату влетел Питерсон; щеки у него буквально пылали от волнения.
– Гусь-то, гусь, мистер Холмс! – задыхаясь, прокричал он.
– Ну? Что с ним такое? Ожил он, что ли, и вылетел в кухонное окно? – Холмс повернулся на
кушетке, чтобы лучше всмотреться в возбужденное лицо Питерсона.
– Посмотрите, сэр! Посмотрите, что жена нашла у него в зобу!
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Питерсон протянул руку, и на ладони его мы увидели ярко сверкающий голубой камень чуть
поменьше горошины. Камень был такой чистой воды, что светился на темной ладони, точно электрическая искра. Холмc присвистнул и опустился на кущетку.
«See what my wife found in its crop!»
– Честной слово, Питерсон, вы нашли сокровище! Надеюсь, вы понимаете, что это такое?
– Алмаз, сэр! Драгоценный камень! Он режет стекло, словно масло!
– Не просто драгоценный камень – это тот самый камень, который…
– Неужели голубой карбункул графини Моркар? – воскликнул я.
– Конечно! Узнаю камень по описаниям, последнее время я каждый день вижу объявления о
его пропаже в «Тайме». Камень этот единственный в своем роде, и можно только догадываться о его
настоящей цене. Награда в тысячу фунтов, которую предлагают нашедшему, едва ли составляет двадцатую долю его стоимости.
– Тысяча фунтов! О, Боже!
Посыльный бухнулся в кресло, изумленно тараща на нас глаза.
– Награда наградой, но у меня есть основания думать, – сказал Холмс, – что по некоторым соображениям графиня отдаст половину всех своих богатств, только бы вернуть этот камень.
– Если память мне не изменяет, он пропал в гостинице «Космополитен», – заметил я.
– Совершенно верно, двадцать второго декабря, ровно пять дней назад. В краже этого камня
обвинен Джон Хорнер, паяльщик. Улики против него так серьезны, что дело направлено в суд. Кажется, у меня есть об этом деле газетный отчет.
Шерлок Холмс долго рылся в газетах, наконец вытащил одну, разгладил ее, сложил пополам и
прочитал следующее:
«КРАЖА ДРАГОЦЕННОСТЕЙ В ОТЕЛЕ „КОСМОПОЛИТЕН“
Джон Хорнер, 26 лет, обвиняется в том, что 22 сего месяца похитил у графини Моркар из шкатулки драгоценный камень, известный под названием «Голубой карбункул».
Джеймс Райдер, служащий отеля, показал, что в день кражи Хорнер припаивал расшатанный прут каминной решетки в комнате графини Моркар. Некоторое время Райдер находился в комнате с Хорнером, но потом его куда-то вызвали. Возвратившись, он увидел,
что Хорнер исчез, бюро взломано и маленький сафьяновый футляр, в котором, как выяснилось впоследствии, графиня имела обыкновение держать дагоценный камень, валялся
пустой на туалетном столике. Райдер сейчас же сообщил в полицию, и в тот же вечер
Хорнер был арестован, но камня не нашли ни при нем, ни у него дома. Кэтрин Кыосек,
горничная графини, показала, что, услышав отчаянный крик Райдера, она вбежала в комнату и тоже увидела пустой футляр. Полицейский инспектор Бродстрит из округа «Б» сообщил, что Хорнер отчаянно сопротивлялся при аресте и горячо доказывал свою невиновность. Поскольку стало известно, что арестованный и прежде судился за кражу, судья
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
отказался разбирать дело и передал его суду присяжных. Хорнер, все время высказывавший признаки сильнейшего волнения, упал в обморок и был вынесен из зала суда».
– Гм! Вот и все, что дает нам полицейский суд, – задумчиво сказал Холмс, откладывая газету. –
Наша задача теперь – выяснить, каким образом из футляра графини камень попал в гусиный зоб. Видите, Уотсон, наши скромные размышления оказались не такими уж незначительными. Итак, вот камень. Этот камень был в гусе, а гусь у мистера Генри Бейкера, у того самого обладателя старой шляпы, которого я пытался охарактеризовать, чем и нагнал на вас невыносимую скуку. Что ж, теперь мы
должны серьезно заняться розысками этого джентльмена и установить, какую роль он играл в таинственном происшествии. Прежде всего испробуем самый простой способ: напечатаем объявление во
всех вечерних газетах. Если таким путем не достигнем цели, прибегнем к иным методам.
– Что вы напишете в объявлении?
– Дайте мне карандаш и клочок бумаги. «На углу Гуджстрит найдены гусь и черная фетровая
шляпа. Мистер Генри Бейкер может получить их сегодня на Бейкер-стрит, 221-б, в 6.30 вечера». Коротко и ясно.
– Весьма. Но заметит ли он объявление?
– Конечно. Он просматривает теперь все газеты: человек он бедный, и рождественский гусь для
него целое состояние. Он до такой степени был напуган, услышав звон разбитого стекла и увидев бегущего Питерсона, что кинулся бежать, не думая ни о чем. Но потом он, конечно, пожалел, что испугался и бросил гуся. В газете мы упоминаем его имя, и любой знакомый обратит его внимание на
нашу публикацию… Так вот, Питерсон, бегите в бюро объявлений, чтобы они поместили эти строки
в вечерних газетах.
– В каких, сэр?
– В «Глоб», «Стар», «Пэлл-Мэлл», «Сент-Джеймс газетт», «Ивнинг ньюс стандард», «Эхо» – во
всех, какие придут вам на ум.
– Слушаю, сэр! А как быть с камнем?
– Ах да! Камень я пока оставлю у себя. Благодарю вас. А на обратном пути, Питерсон, купите
гуся и принесите его мне. Мы ведь должны дать этому джентльмену гуся взамен того, которым в настоящее время угощается ваша семья.
Посыльный ушел, а Холмс взял камень и стал рассматривать его на свет.
– Славный камешек! – сказал он. – Взгляните, как он сверкает и искрится. Как и всякий драгоценный камень, он притягивает к себе преступников, словно магнит. Вот уж подлинно ловушка сатаны. В больших старых камнях каждая грань может рассказать о каком-нибудь кровавом злодеянии.
Этому камню нет еще и двадцати лет. Его нашли на берегу реки Амоу, в Южном Китае, и замечателен он тем, что имеет все свойства карбункула, кроме одного: он не рубиново-красный, а голубой.
Несмотря на его молодость, с ним уже связано много ужасных историй. Из-за сорока граней кристаллического углерода многих ограбили, кого-то облили серной кислотой, было два убийства и одно
самоубийство. Кто бы сказал, что такая красивая безделушка ведет людей в тюрьму и на виселицу! Я
запру камень в свой несгораемый шкаф и напишу графине, что он у нас.
– Как вы считаете, Хорнер не виновен?
– Не знаю.
– А Генри Бейкер замешан в это дело?
– Вернее всего, Генри Бейкер здесь ни при чем. Я думаю, ему и в голову не пришло, что, будь
этот гусь из чистого золота, он и то стоил бы дешевле. Все очень скоро прояснится, если Генри Бейкер откликнется на наше объявление.
– А до тех пор вы ничего не хотите предпринять?
– Ничего.
– В таком случае я навещу своих пациентов, а вечером снова приду сюда. Я хочу знать, чем
окончится это запутанное дело.
– Буду рад вас видеть. Я обедаю в семь. Кажется, к обеду будет куропатка. Кстати, в связи с недавними событиями не попросить ли миссис Хадсон тщательно осмотреть ее зоб?
Я немного задержался, и было уже больше половины седьмого, когда я снова попал на Бейкерстрит. Подойдя к дому Холмса, я увидел, что в ярком полукруге света, падавшем из окна над дверью,
стоит высокий мужчина в шотландской шапочке и в наглухо застегнутом до подбородка сюртуке.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Как раз в тот момент, когда я подошел, дверь отперли, и мы одновременно вошли к Шерлоку Холмсу.
– Если не ошибаюсь, мистер Генри Бейкер? – сказал Холмс, поднимаясь с кресла и встречая посетителя с тем непринужденным радушным видом, который он так умело напускал на себя. – Пожалуйста, присаживайтесь поближе к огню, мистер Бейкер. Вечер сегодня холодный, а мне кажется,
лето вы переносите лучше, чем зиму… Уотсон, вы пришли как раз вовремя… Это ваша шляпа, мистер Бейкер?
– Да, сэр, это, несомненно, моя шляпа. Бейкер был крупный, сутулый человек с большой головой, с широким умным лицом и остроконечной каштановой бородкой. Красноватые пятна на носу и
щеках и легкое дрожание протянутой руки подтверждали догадку Холмса о его наклонностях. На
нем был порыжелый сюртук, застегнутый на все пуговицы, а на тощих запястьях, торчащих из рукавов, не было видно манжет. Он говорил глухо и отрывисто, старательно подбирая слова, и производил впечатление человека интеллигентного, но сильно помятого жизнью.
– У нас уже несколько дней хранится ваша шляпа и ваш гусь, – сказал Холмс. – Мы ждали, что
вы дадите в газете объявление о пропаже. Не понимаю, почему вы этого не сделали.
Наш посетитель смущенно усмехнулся.
– У меня не так много шиллингов, как бывало когда-то, – сказал он. – Я был уверен, что хулиганы, напавшие на меня унесли с собой и шляпу, и птицу, и не хотел тратить деньги по-пустому.
– Вполне естественно. Между прочим, нам ведь пришлось съесть вашего гуся.
– Съесть? – Наш посетитель в волнении поднялся со стула.
– Да ведь он все равно испортился бы, – продолжал Холмс. – Но я полагаю, что вон та птица на
буфете, совершенно свежая и того же веса, заменит вам вашего гуся.
– О, конечно, конечно! – ответил мистер Бейкер, облегченно вздохнув.
– Правда, у нас от вашей птицы остались перья, лапки и зоб, так что, если захотите…
Бейкер от души расхохотался.
– Разве только на память о моем приключении, – сказал он. – Право, не знаю, на что мне могут
пригодиться disjecta membra21 моего покойного знакомца! Нет, сэр, с вашего разрешения я лучше ограничусь тем превосходным гусем, которого я вижу на буфете Шерлок Холмс многозначительно посмотрел на меня и чуть заметно пожал плечами. – Итак, вот ваша шляпа и ваш гусь, – сказал он. –
Кстати, не скажете ли мне, где вы достали того гуся? Я кое-что смыслю в птице и, признаться, редко
видывал столь откормленный экземпляр. – Охотно, сэр, – сказал Бейкер, встав и сунув под мышку
своего нового гуся. – Наша небольшая компания посещает трактир «Альфа», близ Британского музея, мы, понимаете ли, проводим в музее целый день. А в этом году хозяин трактира Уиндигейт, отличный человек, основал «гусиный клуб». Каждый из нас выплачивает по нескольку пенсов в неделю
и к Рождеству получает гуся. Я целиком выплатил свою долю, ну а остальное вам известно. Весьма
обязан вам, сэр, – ведь неудобно солидному человеку в моем возрасте носить шотландскую шапочку.
Он поклонился нам с комически торжественным видом и ушел.

He bowed solemnly to both of us.
– С Генри Бейкером покончено, – сказал Холмс, закрывая за ним дверь. – Совершенно очевидно, что он понятия не имеет о драгоценном камне. Вы очень голодны, Уотсон?
– Не особенно.
– Тогда я предлагаю превратить обед в ужин и немедленно отправиться по горячим следам.
– Я готов.
Был морозный вечер, и нам пришлось надеть пальто и обмотать себе шею шарфом. Звезды холодно сияли на безоблачном, ясном небе, и пар от дыхания прохожих был похож на дымки от пистолетных выстрелов. Четко и гулко раздавались по улицам наши шаги. Мы шли по Уимпол-стрит, Харли-стрит, через Уитмор-стрит, вышли на Оксфорд-стрит и через четверть часа были в Блумсбери,
возле трактира «Альфа», скромного заведения на углу одной из улиц, ведущих к Холборну. Холмс
вошел в бар и заказал две кружки пива краснощекому трактирщику в белом переднике.
– У вас, надо полагать, превосходное пиво, если оно не хуже ваших гусей, – сказал Холмс.
– Моих гусей? – Трактирщик, казалось, был изумлен.
– Да. Полчаса назад я беседовал с мистером Генри Бейкером, членом вашего «гусиного клуба».
– А, понимаю. Но видите ли, сэр, гуси-то ведь не мои.
– В самом деле? А чьи же?
– Я купил две дюжины гусей у одного торговца в Ковент-Гарден.
– Да ну? Я знаю кое-кого из них. У кого же вы купили?
– Его зовут Брекинридж.
– Нет, Брекинриджа я не знаю. Ну, за ваше здоровье, хозяин, и за процветание вашего заведения! Доброй ночи!
– А теперь к мистеру Брекинриджу, – сказал Холмс, выходя на мороз и застегивая пальто. – Не
забудьте, Уотсон, что на одном конце нашей цепи всего только безобидный гусь, зато к другому ее
концу прикован человек, которому грозит не меньше семи лет каторги, если мы не докажем его невиновность. Возможно, впрочем, что наши розыски обнаружат, что виноват именно он, но, во всяком
случае, в наших руках нить, ускользнувшая от полиции и случайно попавшая к нам. Дойдем же до
конца этой нити, как бы печален этот конец ни был. Итак, поворот на юг, и шагом марш!
Мы пересекли Холборн, пошли по Энделл-стрит и через какие-то трущобы вышли на Ковентгарденский рынок. На одной из самых больших лавок было написано: «Брекинридж». Хозяин лавки,
человек с лошадиным лицом и холеными бакенбардами, помогал мальчику запирать ставни.
– Добрый вечер! Каков морозец, а? – сказал Холмс.
Торговец кивнул головой, бросив вопросительный взгляд на моего друга.
– Гуси, видно, распроданы? – продолжал Холмс, указывая на пустой мраморный прилавок.
– Завтра утром можете купить хоть пятьсот штук.
– Завтра они мне ни к чему.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Вон в той лавке, где горит свет, кое-что осталось.
– Да? Но меня направили к вам.
– Кто же?
– Хозяин «Альфы».
– А! Я отослал ему две дюжины.
– Отличные были гуси! Откуда вы их достали?
К моему удивлению, вопрос этот привел торговца в бешенство.
– А ну-ка, мистер, – сказал он, поднимая голову и упирая руки в бока, – к чему вы клоните? Говорите прямо.
– Я говорю достаточно прямо. Мне хотелось бы знать, кто продал вам тех гусей, которых вы
поставляете в «Альфу».
– Вот и не скажу.
– Не скажете – и не надо. Велика важность! Чего вы кипятитесь из-за таких пустяков?
– Кипячусь? Небось, на моем месте и вы кипятились бы, если бы к вам так приставали! Я плачу
хорошие деньги за хороший товар, и, казалось бы, дело с концом. Так нет: «где гуси?», «у кого вы
купили гусей?», «кому вы продали гусей?» Можно подумать, что на этих гусях свет клином сошелся,
когда послушаешь, какой из-за них подняли шум!
– Какое мне дело до других, которые пристают к вам с расспросами! – небрежно сказал
Холмс. – Не хотите говорить – не надо. Но я понимаю толк в птице и держал пари на пять фунтов
стерлингов, что гусь, которого я ел, выкормлен в деревне.
– Вот и пропали ваши фунты! Гусь-то городской! – выпалил торговец.
– Быть не может.
– А я говорю, городской!
– Ни за что не поверю!
– Уж не думаете ли вы, что смыслите в этом деле больше меня? Я ведь этим делом занимаюсь
чуть не с пеленок. Говорю вам, все гуси, проданные в «Альфу», выкормлены в городе.
– И не пытайтесь меня убедить в этом.
– Хотите пари?
– Это значило бы попросту взять у вас деньги. Я уверен, что прав. Но у меня при себе есть соверен, и я готов поставить его, чтобы проучить вас за упрямство.
Торговец ухмыльнулся.
– Принеси-ка мне книги, Билл, – сказал он.
Мальчишка принес две книги: одну тоненькую, а другую большую, засаленную, и положил их
на прилавок под лампой.
– Ну-с, мистер Спорщик, – сказал торговец, – я считал, что сегодня распродал всех гусей, но,
ей-ей, Бог занес ко мне в лавку еще одного. Видите эту книжку?
– Ну и что же?
– Это список тех, у кого я покупаю товар. Видите? Вот здесь, на этой странице, имена деревенских поставщиков, а цифра после каждой фамилии обозначает страницу в гроссбухе, где ведутся их
счета. А эту страницу, исписанную красными чернилами, видите? Это список моих городских поставщиков. Взгляните-ка на третью фамилию. Прочтите ее вслух.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Just read it out to me.»
– «Миссис Окшотт, Брикстон-роуд, 117, страница 249», – прочел Холмс.
– Совершенно правильно. Теперь откройте 249-ю страницу в гроссбухе.
Холмс открыл указанную страницу: «Миссис Окшотт, Брикстон-роуд, 117 – поставщица дичи и
яиц».
– А что гласит последняя запись?
– «Декабрь, двадцать второго. Двадцать четыре гуся по семь шиллингов шесть пенсов».
– Правильно. Запомните это. А внизу?
– «Проданы мистеру Уиндигейту, „Альфа“, по двенадцать шиллингов».
– Ну, что вы теперь скажете?
Шерлок Холмс, казалось, был глубоко огорчен. Вынув соверен из кармана, он бросил его на
прилавок, повернулся и вышел молча, с расстроенным видом. Однако, пройдя несколько шагов, он
остановился под фонарем и рассмеялся своим особенным – веселым и беззвучным – смехом.
– Если у человека такие бакенбарды и такой красный платок в кармане, у него можно выудить
все что угодно, предложив ему пари, – сказал он. – Я утверждаю, что и за сто фунтов мне не удалось
бы получить у него такие подробные сведения, какие я получил, побившись с ним об заклад. Итак,
Уотсон, мне кажется, что мы почти у цели. Единственное, что нам осталось решить, – пойдем ли мы
к этой миссис Окшотт сейчас или отложим наше посещение до утра. Из слов того грубияна ясно, что
этим делом интересуется еще кто-то и я…
Громкий шум, донесшийся внезапно из лавки, которую мы только что покинули, не дал Холмсу
договорить. Обернувшись, мы увидели в желтом свете качающейся лампы какого-то невысокого,
краснолицого человека. Брекинридж, стоя в дверях лавки, яростно потрясал перед ним кулаками.
– Хватит с меня и вас и ваших гусей! – орал Брекинридж. – Проваливайте вы все к дьяволу! Если вы еще раз сунетесь ко мне с дурацкими расспросами, я спущу цепную собаку. Приведите сюда
миссис Окшотт, ей я отвечу. А выто тут при чем? Ваших, что ли, я купил гусей!
– Нет, но все же один из них мой, – захныкал человек.
– Ну и спрашивайте его тогда у миссис Окшотт!
– Она мне велела узнать у вас.
– Спрашивайте хоть у прусского короля! С меня хватит! Убирайтесь отсюда! – Он яростно бросился вперед, и человечек быстро исчез во мраке.
– Ага, нам, кажется, не придется идти на Брикстон-роуд, – прошептал Холмс. – Пойдем посмотрим, не пригодится ли нам этот субъект.
Пробираясь между кучками ротозеев, бродящих вокруг освещенных ларьков, мой друг быстро
нагнал человечка и положил ему руку на плечо. Тот порывисто обернулся, и при свете газового фонаря я увидел, как сильно он побледнел.
– Кто вы такой? Что вам надо? – спросил он дрожащим голосом.
– Извините меня, – мягко сказал Холмс, – но я случайно слышал, что вы спрашивали у этого
торговца. Я думаю, что могу быть вам полезен.
– Вы? Кто вы такой? Откуда вы знаете, что мне нужно?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Меня зовут Шерлок Холмс. Моя профессия – знать то, чего не знают другие.
– О том, что мне нужно, вы ничего не можете знать.
– Прошу прощения, но я знаю все. Вы пытаетесь установить, куда попали гуси, проданные миссис Окшотт с Брикстон-роуд торговцу Брекинриджу, который, в свою очередь, продал их мистеру
Уиндигейту, владельцу «Альфы», а тот передал «гусиному клубу», членом которого является Генри
Бейкер.
– Сэр, вы-то мне и нужны! – вскричал человек, протягивая дрожащие руки. – Я просто не могу
выразить, как все это важно для меня!
«You are the very man.»
Шерлок Холмс остановил проезжавшего извозчика.
– В таком случае лучше разговаривать в уютной комнате, чем тут, на ветреной рыночной площади, – сказал он. – Но прежде чем отправиться в путь, скажите, пожалуйста, кому я имею удовольствие оказывать посильную помощь?
Человечек заколебался на мгновение.
– Меня зовут Джон Робинсон, – сказал он, отводя глаза.
– Нет, мне нужно настоящее имя, – ласково сказал Холмс. – Гораздо удобнее иметь дело с человеком, который действует под своим настоящим именем.
Бледные щеки незнакомца загорелись румянцем.
– В таком случае, – сказал он, – мое имя – Джеймс Райдер.
– Так я и думал. Вы служите в отеле «Космополитен». Садитесь, пожалуйста, в кэб, и вскоре я
расскажу вам все, что вы пожелаете узнать.
Маленький человечек не двигался с места. Он смотрел то на Холмса, то на меня с надеждой и
испугом: он не знал, ждет ли его беда или удача. Наконец он сел в экипаж, и через полчаса мы были в
гостиной на Бейкер-стрит.
Дорогой никто не произнес ни слова. Но спутник наш так учащенно дышал, так крепко сжимал
и разжимал ладони, что было ясно, в каком нервном возбуждении он пребывает.
– Ну, вот мы и дома! – весело сказал Холмс. – Что может быть лучше пылающего камина в такую погоду! Вы, кажется, озябли, мистер Райдер. Садитесь, пожалуйста, в плетеное кресло. Я только
надену домашние туфли, и мы сейчас же займемся вашим делом. Ну вот, готово! Так вы хотите
знать, что стало с теми гусями?
– Да, сэр.
– Пожалуй, вернее, с тем гусем? Мне кажется, вас интересовал лишь один из них – белый, с
черной полосой на хвосте…
Райдер затрепетал от волнения.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– О, сэр! – вскричал он. – Вы можете сказать, где находится этот гусь?
– Он был здесь.
– Здесь?
– Да, и оказался необыкновенным гусем. Не удивительно, что вы заинтересовались им. После
своей кончины он снес яичко – прелестное, сверкающее голубое яичко. Оно здесь, в моей коллекции.
Наш посетитель, шатаясь, поднялся с места и правой рукой ухватился за каминную полку.
Холмс открыл несгораемый шкаф и вытащил оттуда голубой карбункул, сверкавший, словно звезда,
холодным, ярким, переливчатым блеском. Райдер стоял с искаженным лицом, не зная, потребовать
ли камень себе или отказаться от него.
– Игра проиграна, Райдер, – спокойно сказал Шерлок Холмс. – Держитесь крепче на ногах, не
то упадете в огонь. Помогите ему сесть, Уотсон. Он еще не умеет хладнокровно мошенничать. Дайте
ему глоток бренди. Так! Теперь он хоть немного похож на человека. Ну и жалкая же личность!
Райдер едва держался на ногах, но водка вызвала у него на щеках слабый румянец, и он сел, испуганно глядя на своего обличителя.
– Я знаю почти все, у меня в руках почти все улики, и вы не многое сможете добавить. И всетаки рассказывайте, чтобы в деле не оставалось ни малейшей неясности. Откуда вы узнали, Райдер, о
голубом карбункуле графини Моркар?
– Мне сказала о нем Кэтрин Кьюсек, – ответил тот дрожащим голосом.
– Знаю, горничная ее сиятельства. И искушение легко завладеть богатством оказалось сильнее
вас, как это неоднократно бывало и с более достойными людьми. И вы не особенно выбирали средства для достижения своей цели. Мне кажется, Райдер, из вас получится порядочный негодяй! Вы знали, что этот паяльщик Хорнер был уже уличен в воровстве и что подозрения раньше всего падут на
него. Что же вы сделали? Вы сломали прут каминной решетки в комнате графини – вы и ваша сообщница Кьюсек – и устроили так, что именно Хорнера послали сделать ремонт. Когда Хорнер ушел,
вы взяли камень из футляра, подняли тревогу, и бедняга был арестован. После этого…
«Have mercy!» he shrieked.
Тут Райдер внезапно сполз на ковер и обеими руками обхватил колени моего друга.
– Ради Бога, сжальтесь надо мной! – закричал он. – Подумайте о моем отце, о моей матери. Это
убьет их! Я никогда не воровал, никогда! Это не повторится, клянусь вам! Я поклянусь вам на Библии! О, не доводите этого дела до суда! Ради Христа, не доводите дела до суда!
– Ступайте на место, – сурово сказал Холмс. – Сейчас вы готовы ползать на коленях. А что вы
думали, когда отправляли беднягу Хорнера на скамью подсудимых за преступление, в котором он не
повинен?
– Я могу скрыться, мистер Холмс! Я уеду из Англии, сэр! Тогда обвинение против него отпадет…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Гм, мы еще потолкуем об этом. А пока послушаем, что же действительно случилось после воровства. Каким образом камень попал в гуся, и как этот гусь попал на рынок? Говорите правду, ибо
для вас правда – единственный путь к спасению.
Райдер повел языком по пересохшим губам.
– Я расскажу всю правду, – сказал он. – Когда арестовали Хорнера, я решил, что мне лучше
унести камень на случай, если полиции придет в голову обыскать меня и мою комнату. В гостинице
не было подходящего места, чтобы спрятать камень. Я вышел, будто бы по служебному делу, и отправился к своей сестре. Она замужем за неким Окшоттом, живет на Брикстон-роуд и занимается
тем, что откармливает домашнюю птицу, для рынка. Каждый встречный казался мне полицейским
или сыщиком, и, несмотря на холодный ветер, пот градом струился у меня по лбу. Сестра спросила,
почему я так бледен, не случилось ли чего. Я сказал, что меня взволновала кража драгоценности в
нашем отеле. Потом я прошел на задний двор, закурил трубку и стал раздумывать, что бы предпринять.
Есть у меня приятель по имени Модели, который сбился с пути и только что отбыл срок наказания в Пентонвиллской тюрьме. Мы встретились с ним, разговорились, и он рассказал мне, как воры
сбывают краденое. Я понимал, что он меня не выдаст, так как я сам знал за ним кое-какие грехи, и
потому решил идти прямо к нему в Килберн и посвятить его в свою тайну. Он научил бы меня, как
превратить этот камень в деньги. Но как добраться туда? Я вспомнил о тех терзаниях, которые пережил по пути из гостиницы. Каждую минуту меня могли схватить, обыскать и найти камень в моем
жилетном кармане. Я стоял, прислонившись к стене, рассеянно глядя на гусей, которые, переваливаясь, бродили у моих ног, и внезапно мне пришла в голову мысль, как обмануть самого ловкого сыщика в мире…
Несколько недель назад сестра обещала, что к Рождеству я получу от нее отборнейшего гуся в
подарок, а она слово держит. И я решил взять гуся сейчас же и в нем пронести камень. Во дворе был
какой-то сарай, я загнал за него огромного, очень хорошего гуся, белого, с полосатым хвостом. Потом поймал его, раскрыл ему клюв и как можно глубже засунул камень ему в глотку. Гусь глотнул, и
я ощутил рукою, как камень прошел в зоб. Но гусь бился и хлопал крыльями, и сестра вышла узнать
в чем дело. Я повернулся, чтобы ответить, и негодный гусь вырвался у меня из рук и смещался со
стадом.
«Что ты делал с птицей, Джеймс?» – спросила сестра.
«Да вот ты обещала подарить мне гуся к Рождеству. Я и пробовал, какой из них пожирнее».
«О, мы уже отобрали для тебя гуся, – сказала она, – мы так и называли его: „Гусь Джеймса“.
Вон тот, большой, белый. Гусей всего двадцать шесть, из них один тебе, а две дюжины на продажу».
«Спасибо, Мэгги, – сказал я. – Но если тебе все равно, дай мне того, которого я поймал».
«Твой тяжелее по крайне мере фунта на три, и мы специально откармливали его».
«Ничего, мне хочется именно этого, я бы сейчас и взял его с собой».
«Твое дело, – сказала сестра обиженно. – Какого же ты хочешь взять?»
«Вон того белого, с черной полосой на хвосте… Вон он, в середине стада».
«Пожалуйста, режь его и бери!»
Я так и сделал, мистер Холмс, и понес птицу в Килберн. Я рассказал своему приятелю обо всем
– он из тех, с которыми можно говорить без стеснения. Он хохотал до упаду, потом мы взяли нож и
разрезали гуся. У меня остановилось сердце, когда я увидел, что произошла ужасная ошибка, и камня
нет. Я бросил гуся, пустился бегом к сестре. Влетел на задний двор – гусей там не было.
«Где гуси, Мэгги?» – крикнул я.
«Отправила торговцу».
«Какому торговцу?»
«Брекинриджу на Ковент-Гарден».
«А был среди них один с полосатым хвостом – такой же, какого я взял?» – спросил я.
«Да, Джеймс, ведь было два гуся с полосатыми хвостами, я вечно путала их».
Тут, конечно, я понял все и со всех ног помчался к этому самому Брекинриджу. Но он уже распродал гусей и не хотел сказать кому. Вы слышали сами, как он со мной разговаривал. Сестра думает, что я сошел с ума. Порой мне самому кажется, что я сумасшедший. И вот… теперь я презренный
вор, хотя даже не прикоснулся к богатству, ради которого погубил себя. Боже, помоги мне! Боже,
помоги! – Он закрыл лицо руками и судорожно зарыдал.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He burst into convulsive sobbing.
Потом наступило долгое молчание, лишь слышны были тяжелые вздохи Райдера, да мой друг
мерно постукивал пальцами по столу. Вдруг Шерлок Холмс встал и распахнул настежь дверь.
– Убирайтесь! – проговорил он.
– Что? Сэр, да благословит вас небо!
– Ни слова! Убирайтесь отсюда!
Повторять не пришлось. На лестнице загрохотали стремительные шаги, внизу хлопнула дверь,
и с улицы донесся быстрый топот.
– В конце концов, Уотсон, – сказал Холмс, протягивая руку к глиняной трубке, – я работаю отнюдь не затем, чтобы исправлять промахи нашей полиции. Если бы Хорнеру грозила опасность, тогда другое дело. Но Райдер не станет показывать против него, и обвинение рухнет. Возможно, я укрываю мошенника, но зато спасаю его душу. С этим молодцом ничего подобного не повторится, – он
слишком напуган. Упеките его сейчас в тюрьму, и он не развяжется с ней всю жизнь. Кроме того,
нынче праздники, надо прощать грехи. Случай столкнул нас со странной и забавной загадкой, и решить ее – само по себе награда. Если вы будете любезны и позволите, мы немедленно займемся новым «исследованием», в котором опять-таки фигурирует птица: ведь к обеду у нас куропатка.

The Adventure of the Speckled Band
First published in the Strand Magazine, Feb. 1892,
with 9 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
Просматривая свои записи о приключениях Шерлока Холмса, – а таких записей, которые я вел
на протяжении последних восьми лет, у меня больше семидесяти, – я нахожу в них немало трагических случаев, есть среди них и забавные, есть и причудливые, но нет ни одного заурядного: работая
из любви к своему искусству, а не ради денег, Холмс никогда не брался за расследование обыкновенных, будничных дел, его всегда привлекали только такие дела, в которых есть что-нибудь необычайное, а порою даже фантастическое.
Особенно причудливым кажется мне дело хорошо известной в Суррее семьи Ройлоттов из
Сток-Морона. Мы с Холмсом, два холостяка, жил тогда вместе на Бейкер-стрит. Вероятно, я бы и
раньше опубликовал свои записи, но я дал слово держать это дело в тайне и освободился от своего
слова лишь месяц назад, после безвременной кончиты той женщины, которой оно было дано. Пожалуй, будет небесполезно представить это дело в истинном свете, потому что молва приписывала
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
смерть доктора Гримеби Ройлотта еще более ужасным обстоятельствам, чем те, которые были в действительности.
Проснувшись в одно апрельское утро 1883 года, я увидел, что Шерлок Холмс стоит у моей кровати. Одет он был не по-домашнему. Обычно он поднимался с постели поздно, но теперь часы на камине показывали лишь четверть восьмого. Я посмотрел на него с удивлением и даже несколько укоризненно. Сам я был верен своим привычкам.
– Весьма сожалею, что разбудил вас, Уотсон, – сказал он.
– Но такой уж сегодня день. Разбудили миссис Хадсон, она – меня, а я – вас.
– Что же такое? Пожар?
– Нет, клиентка. Приехала какая-то девушка, она ужасно взволнована и непременно желает повидаться со мной. Она ждет в приемной. А уж если молодая дама решается в столь ранний час путешествовать по улицам столицы и поднимать с постели незнакомого человека, я полагаю, она хочет
сообщить что-то очень важное. Дело может оказаться интересным, и вам, конечно, хотелось бы услышать эту историю с самого первого слова. Вот я и решил предоставить вам эту возможность.
– Буду счастлив услышать такую историю.
Я не хотел большего наслаждения, как следовать за Холмсом во время его профессиональных
занятий и любоваться его стремительной мыслью. Порой казалось, что он решает предлагаемые ему
загадки не разумом, а каким-то вдохновенным чутьем, но на самом деле все его выводы были основаны на точной и строгой логике.
Я быстро оделся, и через несколько минут мы спустились в гостиную. Дама, одетая в черное, с
густой вуалью на лице, поднялась при нашем появлении.
– Доброе утро, сударыня, – сказал Холмс приветливо. – Меня зовут Шерлок Холмс. Это мой
близкий друг и помощник, доктор Уотсон, с которым вы можете быть столь же откровенны, как и со
мной. Ага! Как хорошо, что миссис Хадсон догадалась затопить камин. Я вижу, вы очень продрогли.
Присаживайтесь поближе к огню и разрешите предложить вам чашку кофе.
– Не холод заставляет меня дрожать, мистер Холмс, – тихо сказала женщина, подсаживаясь к
камину.
– А что же?
– Страх, мистер Холмс, ужас!
С этими словами она подняла вуаль, и мы увидели, как она возбуждена, какое у нее посеревшее, осунувшееся лицо. В ее глазах был испуг, словно у затравленного зверя. Ей было не больше
тридцати лет, но в волосах уже блестела седина, и выглядела она усталой и измученной.
She raised her veil.
Шерлок Холмс окинул ее своим быстрым всепонимающим взглядом.
– Вам нечего бояться, – сказал он, ласково погладив ее по руке. – Я уверен, что нам удастся
уладить все неприятности… Вы, я вижу, приехали утренним поездом.
– Разве вы меня знаете?
– Нет, но я заметил в вашей левой перчатке обратный билет. Вы сегодня рано встали, а потом,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
направляясь на станцию, долго тряслись в двуколке по скверной дороге.
Дама резко вздрогнула и в замешательстве взглянула на Холмса.
– Здесь нет никакого чуда, сударыня, – сказал он, улыбнувшись. – Левый рукав вашего жакета
по крайней мере в семи местах забрызган грязью. Пятна совершенно свежие. Так обрызгаться можно
только в двуколке, сидя слева от кучера.
– Все так и было, – сказала она. – Около шести часов я выбралась из дому, в двадцать минут
седьмого была в Летерхеде и с первым поездом приехала в Лондон, на вокзал Ватерлоо… Сэр, я
больше не вынесу этого, я сойду с ума! У меня нет никого, к кому я могла бы обратиться. Есть, впрочем, один человек, который принимает во мне участие, но чем он мне может помочь, бедняга? Я
слышала о вас, мистер Холмс, слышала от миссис Фаринтош, которой вы помогли в минуту горя.
Она дала мне ваш адрес. О сэр, помогите и мне или по крайней мере попытайтесь пролить хоть немного света в тот непроницаемый мрак, который окружает меня! Я не в состоянии отблагодарить вас
сейчас за ваши услуги, но через месяц-полтора я буду замужем, тогда у меня будет право распоряжаться своими доходами, и вы увидите, что я умею быть благодарной.
Холмс подошел к конторке, открыл ее, достал оттуда записную книжку.
– Фаринтош… – сказал он. – Ах да, я вспоминаю этот случай. Он связан с тиарой из опалов.
По-моему, это было еще до нашего знакомства, Уотсон. Могу вас уверить, сударыня, что я буду счастлив отнестись к вашему делу с таким же усердием, с каким отнесся к делу вашей приятельницы. А
вознаграждения мне никакого не нужно, так как моя работа и служит мне вознаграждением. Конечно, у меня будут кое-какие расходы, и их вы можете возместить, когда вам будет угодно. А теперь
попрошу вас сообщить нам подробности вашего дела, чтобы мы могли иметь свое суждение о нем.
– Увы! – ответила девушка. – Ужас моего положения заключается в том, что мои страхи так неопределенны и смутны, а подозрения основываются на таких мелочах, казалось бы, не имеющих никакого значения, что даже тот, к кому я имею право обратиться за советом и помощью, считает все
мои рассказы бреднями нервной женщины. Он не говорит мне ничего, но я читаю это в его успокоительных словах и уклончивых взглядах. Я слышала, мистер Холмс, что вы, как никто, разбираетесь
во всяких порочных наклонностях человеческого сердца и можете посоветовать, что мне делать среди окружающих меня опасностей.
– Я весь внимание, сударыня.
– Меня зовут Элен Стоунер. Я живу в доме моего отчима, Ройлотта. Он является последним отпрыском одной из старейших саксонских фамилий в Англии, Ройлоттов из Сток-Морона, у западной
границы Суррея.
Холмс кивнул головой.
– Мне знакомо это имя, – сказал он.
– Было время, когда семья Ройлоттов была одной из самых богатых в Англии. На севере владения Ройлоттов простирались до Беркшира, а на западе – до Хапшира. Но в прошлом столетии четыре
поколения подряд проматывали семейное состояние, пока наконец один из наследников, страстный
игрок, окончательно не разорил семью во времена регентства. От прежних поместий остались лишь
несколько акров земли да старинный дом, построенный лет двести назад и грозящий рухнуть под
бременем закладных. Последний помещик из этого рода влачил в своем доме жалкое существование
нищего аристократа. Но его единственный сын, мой отчим, поняв, что надо как-то приспособиться к
новому положению вещей, взял взаймы у какого-то родственника необходимую сумму денег, поступил в университет, окончил его с дипломом врача и уехал в Калькутту, где благодаря своему искусству и выдержке вскоре приобрел широкую практику. Но вот в доме у него случилась кража, и Ройлотт в припадке бешенства избил до смерти туземца-дворецкого. С трудом избежав смертной казни,
он долгое время томился в тюрьме, а потом возвратился в Англию угрюмым и разочарованным человеком.
В Индии доктор Ройлотт женился на моей матери, миссис Стоунер, молодой вдове генералмайора артиллерии. Мы были близнецы – я и моя сестра Джулия, и, когда наша мать выходила замуж
за доктора, нам едва минуло два года. Она обладала порядочным состоянием, дававшим ей не меньше тысячи фунтов дохода в год. По ее завещанию, это состояние переходило к доктору Ройлотту, поскольку мы жили вместе. Но если мы выйдем замуж, каждой из нас должна быть выделена определенная сумма годового дохода. Вскоре после нашего возвращения в Англию наша мать умерла – она
погибла восемь лет назад во время железнодорожной катастрофы при Кру. После ее смерти доктор
Ройлотт оставил свои попытки обосноваться в Лондоне и наладить там медицинскую практику и
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
вместе с нами поселился в родовом поместье в Сток-Морон. Состояния нашей матери вполне хватало
на то, чтобы удовлетворять наши потребности, и, казалось, ничто не должно было мешать нашему
счастью.
Но странная перемена произошла с моим отчимом. Вместо того, чтобы подружиться с соседями, которые вначале обрадовались, что Ройлотт из Сток-Морона вернулся в родовое гнездо, он заперся в усадьбе и очень редко выходил из дому, а если и выходил, то всякий раз затевал безобразную
ссору с первым же человеком, который попадался ему на пути. Бешеная вспыльчивость, доходящая
до исступления, передавалась по мужской линии всем представителям этого рода, а у моего отчима
она, вероятно, еще более усилилась благодаря долгому пребыванию в тропиках. Много было у него
яростных столкновений с соседями, два раза дело кончалось полицейским участком. Он сделался
грозой всего селения… Нужно сказать, что он человек невероятной физической силы, и, так как в
припадке гнева совершенно не владеет собой, люди при встрече с ним буквально шарахались в сторону.
На прошлой неделе он швырнул в реку местного кузнеца, и, чтобы откупиться от публичного
скандала, мне пришлось отдать все деньги, какие я могла собрать. Единственные друзья его – кочующие цыгане, он позволяет этим бродягам раскидывать шатры на небольшом, заросшем ежевикой
клочке земли, составляющем все его родовое поместье, и порой кочует вместе с ними, по целым неделям не возвращаясь домой. Еще есть у него страсть к животным, которых присылает ему из Индии
один знакомый, и в настоящее время по его владениям свободно разгуливают гепард и павиан, наводя на жителей почти такой же страх, как и он сам.
«He hurled the blacksmith over a parapet.»
Из моих слов вы можете заключить, что мы с сестрой жили не слишком-то весело. Никто не хотел идти к нам в услужение, и долгое время всю домашнюю работу мы исполняли сами. Сестре было
всего тридцать лет, когда она умерла, а у нее уже начинала пробиваться седина, такая же, как у меня.
– Так ваша сестра умерла?
– Она умерла ровно два года назад, и как раз о ее смерти я и хочу рассказать вам. Вы сами понимаете, что при таком образе жизни мы почти не встречались с людьми нашего возраста и нашего
круга. Правда, у нас есть незамужняя тетка, сестра нашей матери, мисс Гонория Уэстфайл, она живет
близ Харроу, и время от времени нас отпускали погостить у нее. Два года назад моя сестра Джулия
проводила у нее Рождество. Там она встретилась с отставным майором флота, и он сделался ее женихом. Вернувшись домой, она рассказала о своей помолвке нашему отчиму. Отчим не возражал против ее замужества, но за две недели до свадьбы случилось ужасное событие, лишившее меня единственной подруги…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Шерлок Холмс сидел в кресле, откинувшись назад и положив голову на длинную подушку.
Глаза его были закрыты. Теперь он приподнял веки и взглянул на посетительницу.
– Прошу вас рассказывать, не пропуская ни одной подробности, – сказал он.
– Мне легко быть точной, потому что все события тех ужасных дней врезались в мою память…
Как я уже говорила, наш дом очень стар, и только одно крыло пригодно для жилья. В нижнем этаже
размещаются спальни, гостиные находятся в центре. В первой спальне спит доктор Ройлотт, во второй спала моя сестра, а в третьей – я. Спальни не сообщаются между собой, но все они имеют выход
в один коридор. Достаточно ли ясно я рассказываю?
– Да, вполне.
Окна всех трех спален выходят на лужайку. В ту роковую ночь доктор Ройлотт рано удалился в
свою комнату, но мы знали, что он еще не лег, так как сестру мою долго беспокоил запах крепких
индийских сигар, которые он имел привычку курить. Сестра не выносила этого запаха и пришла в
мою комнату, где мы просидели некоторое время, болтая о ее предстоящем замужестве. В одиннадцать часов она поднялась и хотела уйти, но у дверей остановилась и спросила меня:
«Скажи, Элен, не кажется ли тебе, будто кто-то свистит по ночам?»
«Нет», – сказала я.
«Надеюсь, что ты не свистишь во сне?»
«Конечно, нет. А в чем дело?»
«В последнее время, часа в три ночи, мне ясно слышится тихий, отчетливый свист. Я сплю
очень чутко, и свист будит меня. Не могу понять, откуда он доносится, – быть может, из соседней
комнаты, быть может, с лужайки. Я давно уже хотела спросить у тебя, слыхала ли ты его».
«Нет, не слыхала. Может, свистят эти мерзкие цыгане?»
«Очень возможно. Однако, если бы свист доносился с лужайки, ты тоже слышала бы его».
«Я сплю гораздо крепче тебя».
«Впрочем, все это пустяки», – улыбнулась сестра, закрыла мою дверь, и спустя несколько
мгновений я услышала, как щелкнул ключ в ее двери.
– Вот как! – сказал Холмс. – Вы на ночь всегда запираетесь на ключ?
– Всегда.
– А почему?
– Я, кажется, уже упомянула, что у доктора жили гепард и павиан. Мы чувствовали себя в безопасности лишь тогда, когда дверь была закрыта на ключ.
– Понимаю. Прошу продолжать.
– Ночью я не могла уснуть. Смутное ощущение какого-то неотвратимого несчастья охватило
меня. Мы близнецы, а вы знаете, какими тонкими узами связаны столь родственные души. Ночь была
жуткая: выл ветер, дождь барабанил в окна. И вдруг среди грохота бури раздался дикий вопль. То
кричала моя сестра. Я спрыгнула с кровати и, накинув большой платок, выскочила в коридор. Когда
я открыла дверь, мне показалось, что я слышу тихий свист, вроде того, о котором мне рассказывала
сестра, а затем что-то звякнуло, словно на землю упал тяжелый металлический предмет. Подбежав к
комнате сестры, я увидела, что дверь тихонько колышется взад и вперед. Я остановилась, пораженная ужасом, не понимая, что происходит. При свете лампы, горевшей в коридоре, я увидела свою сестру, которая появилась в дверях, шатаясь, как пьяная, с бельм от ужаса лицом, протягивая вперед
руки, словно моля о помощи. Бросившись к ней, я обняла ее, но в это мгновение колени сестры подогнулись, и она рухнула наземь. Она корчилась, словно от нестерпимой боли, руки и ноги ее сводило судорогой. Сначала мне показалось, что она меня не узнает, но когда я склонилась над ней, она
вдруг вскрикнула… О, я никогда не забуду ее страшного голоса.
«Боже мой, Элен! – кричала она. – Лента! Пестрая лента!»
Она пыталась еще что-то сказать, указывая пальцем в сторону комнаты доктора, но новый приступ судорог оборвал ее слова. Я выскочила и, громко крича, побежала за отчимом. Он уже спешил
мне навстречу в ночном халате. Сестра была без сознания, когда он приблизился к ней. Он влил ей в
рот коньяку и тотчас же послал за деревенским врачом, но все усилия спасти ее были напрасны, и
она скончалась, не приходя в сознание. Таков был ужасный конец моей любимой сестры…
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Her face blanched with terror.
– Позвольте спросить, – сказал Холмс. – Вы уверены, что слышали свист и лязг металла? Могли бы вы показать это под присягой?
– Об этом спрашивал меня и следователь. Мне кажется, что я слышала эти звуки, однако меня
могли ввести в заблуждение и завывание бури и потрескивания старого дома.
– Ваша сестра была одета?
– Нет, она выбежала в одной ночной рубашке. В правой руке у нее была обгорелая спичка, а в
левой спичечная коробка.
– Значит, она чиркнула спичкой и стала осматриваться, когда что-то испугало ее. Очень важная
подробность. А к каким выводам пришел следователь?
– Он тщательно изучил все обстоятельства – ведь буйный характер доктора Ройлотта был известен всей округе, но ему так и не удалось найти мало-мальски удовлетворительную причину смерти моей сестры. Я показала на следствии, что дверь ее комнаты была заперта изнутри, а окна защищены снаружи старинными ставнями с широкими железными засовами. Стены были подвергнуты
самому внимательному изучению, но они повсюду оказались очень прочными. Осмотр пола тоже не
дал никаких результатов. Каминная труба широка, но ее перекрывают целых четыре вьюшки. Итак,
нельзя сомневаться, что сестра во время постигшей ее катастрофы была совершенно одна. Никаких
следов насилия обнаружить не удалось.
– А как насчет яда?
– Врачи исследовали ее, но не нашли ничего, что указывало бы на отравление.
– Что же, по-вашему, было причиной смерти?
– Мне кажется, она умерла от ужаса и нервного потрясения. Но я не представляю себе, кто мог
бы ее так напугать.
– А цыгане были в то время в усадьбе?
– Да, цыгане почти всегда живут у нас.
– А что, по-вашему, могли означать ее слова о ленте, о пестрой ленте?
– Иногда мне казалось, что слова эти были сказаны просто в бреду, а иногда – что они относятся к цыганам. Но почему лента пестрая? Возможно, что пестрые платки, которые носят цыганки,
внушили ей этот странный эпитет.
Холмс покачал головой: видимо, объяснение не удовлетворяло его.
– Это дело темное, – сказал он. – Прошу вас, продолжайте.
– С тех пор прошло два года, и жизнь моя была еще более одинокой, чем раньше. Но месяц назад один близкий мне человек, которого я знаю много лет, сделал мне предложение. Его зовут Армитедж, Пэрси Армитедж, он второй сын мистера Армитеджа из Крейнуотера, близ Рединга. Мой отчим не возражал против нашего брака, и этой весной мы должны обвенчаться. Два дня назад в
западном крыле нашего дома начались кое-какие переделки. Была пробита стена моей спальни, и мне
пришлось перебраться в ту комнату, где скончалась сестра, и спать на той самой кровати, на которой
спала она. Можете себе представить мой ужас, когда прошлой ночью, лежа без сна и размышляя о ее
трагической смерти, я внезапно услышала в тишине тот самый тихий свист, который был предвестником гибели сестры. Я вскочила, зажгла лампу, но в комнате никого не было. Снова лечь я не могла
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– я была слишком взволнована, поэтому я оделась и, чуть рассвело, выскользнула из дому, взяла двуколку в гостинице «Корона», которая находится напротив нас, поехала в Летерхед, а оттуда сюда – с
одной только мыслью повидать вас и спросить у вас совета.
– Вы очень умно поступили, – сказал мой друг. – Но все ли вы рассказали мне?
– Да, все.
– Нет, не все, мисс Ройлотт: вы щадите и выгораживаете своего отчима.
– Я не понимаю вас…
Вместо ответа Холмс откинул черную кружевную отделку на рукаве нашей посетительницы.
Пять багровых пятен – следы пяти пальцев – ясно виднелись на белом запястье.
– Да, с вами обошлись жестоко, – сказал Холмс.
Девушка густо покраснела и поспешила опустить кружева.
– Отчим – суровый человек, – сказала она. – Он очень силен, и, возможно, сам не замечает своей силы.
Наступило долгое молчание. Холмс сидел, подперев руками подбородок и глядя на потрескивавший в камине огонь.
– Сложное дело, – сказал он наконец. – Мне хотелось бы выяснить еще тысячу подробностей,
прежде чем решить, как действовать. А между тем нельзя терять ни минуты. Послушайте, если бы
мы сегодня же приехали в Сток-Морон, удалось бы нам осмотреть эти комнаты, но так, чтобы ваш
отчим ничего не узнал.
– Он как раз говорил мне, что собирается ехать сегодня в город по каким-то важным делам.
Возможно, что его не будет весь день, и тогда никто вам не помешает. У нас есть экономка, но она
стара и глупа, и я легко могу удалить ее.
– Превосходно. Вы ничего не имеете против поездки, Уотсон?
– Ровно ничего.
– Тогда мы приедем оба. А что вы сами собираетесь делать?
– У меня в городе есть кое-какие дела. Но я вернусь двенадцатичасовым поездом, чтобы быть
на месте к вашему приезду.
– Ждите нас вскоре после полудня. У меня здесь тоже есть кое-какие дела. Может быть вы останетесь и позавтракаете с нами?
– Нет, мне надо идти! Теперь, когда я рассказала вам о своем горе, у меня просто камень свалился с души. Я буду рада снова увидеться с вами.
Она опустила на лицо черную густую вуаль и вышла из комнаты.
– Так что же вы обо всем этом думаете, Уотсон? – спросил Шерлок Холмс, откидываясь на
спинку кресла.
– По-моему, это в высшей степени темное и грязное дело.
– Достаточно грязное и достаточно темное.
– Но если наша гостья права, утверждая, что пол и стены в комнате крепки, так что через двери,
окна и каминную трубу невозможно туда проникнуть, значит, ее сестра в минуту своей таинственной
смерти была совершенно одна…
– В таком случае, что означают эти ночные свисты и странные слова умирающей?
– Представить себе не могу.
– Если сопоставить факты: ночные свисты, цыгане, с которыми у этого старого доктора такие
близкие отношения, намеки умирающей на какую-то ленту и, наконец, тот факт, что мисс Элен Стоунер слышала металлический лязг, который мог издавать железный засов от ставни… если вспомнить к тому же, что доктор заинтересован в предотвращении замужества своей падчерицы, – я полагаю, что мы напали на верные следы, которые помогут нам разгадать это таинственное
происшествие.
– Но тогда при чем здесь цыгане?
– Понятия не имею.
– У меня все-таки есть множество возражений…
– Да и у меня тоже, и поэтому мы сегодня едем в Сток-Морон. Я хочу проверить все на месте.
Не обернулись бы кое-какие обстоятельства самым роковым образом. Может быть их удастся прояснить. Черт возьми, что это значит?
Так воскликнул мой друг, потому что дверь внезапно широко распахнулась, и в комнату ввалился какой-то субъект колоссального роста. Его костюм представлял собою странную смесь: чер-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ный цилиндр и длинный сюртук указывали на профессию врача, а по высоким гетрам и охотничьему
хлысту в руках его можно было принять за сельского жителя. Он был так высок, что шляпой задевал
верхнюю перекладину нашей двери, и так широк в плечах, что едва протискивался в дверь. Его толстое, желтое от загара лицо со следами всех пороков было перерезано тысячью морщин, а глубоко
сидящие, злобно сверкающие глаза и длинный, тонкий, костлявый нос придавали ему сходство со
старой хищной птицей.
«Which of you is Holmes?»
Он переводил взгляд то на Шерлока Холмса, то на меня.
– Который из вас Холмс? – промолвил наконец посетитель.
– Это мое имя, сэр, – спокойно ответил мой друг. – Но я не знаю вашего.
– Я доктор Гримеби Ройлотт из Сток-Морона.
– Очень рад. Садитесь, пожалуйста, доктор, – любезно сказал Шерлок Холмс.
– Не стану я садиться! Здесь была моя падчерица. Я выследил ее. Что она говорила вам?
– Что-то не по сезону холодная погода нынче, – сказал Холмс.
– Что она говорила вам? – злобно закричал старик.
– Впрочем, я слышал, крокусы будут отлично цвести, – невозмутимо продолжал мой приятель.
– Ага, вы хотите отделаться от меня! – сказал наш гость, делая шаг вперед и размахивая охотничьим хлыстом. – Знаю я вас, подлеца. Я уже и прежде слышал про вас. Вы любите совать нос в
чужие дела.
Мой друг улыбнулся.
– Вы проныра!
Холмс улыбнулся еще шире.
– Полицейская ищейка!
Холмс от души расхохотался.
– Вы удивительно приятный собеседник, – сказал он. – Выходя отсюда, закройте дверь, а то,
право же, сильно сквозит.
– Я выйду только тогда, когда выскажусь. Не вздумайте вмешиваться в мои дела. Я знаю, что
мисс Стоунер была здесь, я следил за ней! Горе тому, кто станет у меня на пути! Глядите!
Он быстро подошел к камину, взял кочергу и согнул ее своими огромными загорелыми руками.
– Смотрите, не попадайтесь мне в лапы! – прорычал он, швырнув искривленную кочергу в камин и вышел из комнаты.
– Какой любезный господин! – смеясь, сказал Холмс. – Я не такой великан, но если бы он не
ушел, мне пришлось бы доказать ему, что мои лапы ничуть не слабее его лап.
С этими словами он поднял стальную кочергу и одним быстрым движением распрямил ее.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Какая наглость смешивать меня с сыщиками из полиции! Что ж, благодаря этому происшествию наши исследования стали еще интереснее. Надеюсь, что наша приятельница не пострадает от
того, что так необдуманно позволила этой скотине выследить себя. Сейчас, Уотсон, мы позавтракаем, а затем я отправлюсь к юристам и наведу у них несколько справок.
Было уже около часа, когда Холмс возвратился домой. В руке у него был лист синей бумаги,
весь исписанный заметками и цифрами.
– Я видел завещание покойной жены доктора, – сказал он.
– Чтобы точнее разобраться в нем, мне пришлось справиться о нынешней стоимости ценных
бумаг, в которых помещено состояние покойной. В год смерти общий доход ее составлял почти тысячу фунтов стерлингов, но с тех пор в связи с падением цен на сельскохозяйственные продукты,
уменьшился до семисот пятидесяти фунтов стерлингов. Выйдя замуж, каждая дочь имеет право на
ежегодный доход в двести пятьдесят фунтов стерлингов. Следовательно, если бы обе дочери вышли
замуж, наш красавец получал бы только жалкие крохи. Его доходы значительно уменьшились бы и в
том случае, если бы замуж вышла лишь одна из дочерей. Я не напрасно потратил утро, так как получил ясные доказательства, что у отчима были весьма веские основания препятствовать замужеству
падчериц. Обстоятельства слишком серьезны, Уотсон, и нельзя терять ни минуты, тем более что старик уже знает, как мы интересуемся его делами. Если вы готовы, надо поскорей вызвать кэб и ехать
на вокзал. Буду вам чрезвычайно признателен, если вы сунете в карман револьвер. Револьвер – превосходный аргумент для джентльмена, который может завязать узлом стальную кочергу. Револьвер
да зубная щетка – вот и все, что нам понадобится.
На вокзале Ватерлоо нам посчастливилось сразу попасть на поезд. Приехав в Летерхед, мы в
гостинице возле станции взяли двуколку и проехали миль пять живописными дорогами Суррея. Был
чудный солнечный день, и лишь несколько перистых облаков плыло по небу. На деревьях и на живой
изгороди возле дорог только что распустились зеленые почки, и воздух был напоен восхитительным
запахом влажной земли.
Странным казался мне контраст между сладостным пробуждением весны и ужасным делом, изза которого мы прибыли сюда. Мой приятель сидел впереди, скрестив руки, надвинув шляпу на глаза, опустив подбородок на грудь, погруженный в глубокие думы. Внезапно он поднял голову, хлопнул меня по плечу и указал куда-то вдаль.
– Посмотрите!
Обширный парк раскинулся по склону холма, переходя в густую рощу на вершине; из-за веток
виднелись очертания высокой крыши и шпиль старинного помещичьего дома.
– Сток-Морон? – спросил Шерлок Холмс.
– Да, сэр, это дом Гримеби Ройлотта, – ответил возница.
– Видите, вон там строят, – сказал Холмс. – Нам нужно попасть туда.
– Мы едем к деревне, – сказал возница, указывая на крыши, видневшиеся в некотором отдалении слева. – Но если вы хотите скорей попасть к дому, вам лучше перелезть здесь через забор, а потом пройти полями по тропинке. По той тропинке, где идет эта леди.
– А эта леди как будто мисс Стоунер, – сказал Холмс, заслоняя глаза от солнца. – Да, мы лучше
пойдем по тропинке, как вы советуете.
We got off, paid our fare.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Мы вышли из двуколки, расплатились, и экипаж покатил обратно в Летерхед.
– Пусть этот малый думает, что мы архитекторы, – сказал Холмс, когда мы лезли через забор, –
тогда наш приезд не вызовет особых толков. Добрый день, мисс Стоунер! Видите, мы сдержали свое
слово!
Наша утренняя посетительница радостно спешила нам навстречу.
– Я с таким нетерпением ждала вас! – воскликнула дна, горячо пожимая нам руки. – Все устроилось чудесно: доктор Ройлотт уехал в город и вряд ли возвратится раньше вечера.
– Мы имели удовольствие познакомиться с доктором, – сказал Холмс и в двух словах рассказал
о том, что произошло.
Мисс Стоунер побледнела.
– Боже мой! – воскликнула она. – Значит, он шел за мной следом!
– Похоже на то.
– Он так хитер, что я никогда не чувствую себя в безопасности. Что он скажет, когда возвратится?
– Придется ему быть осторожнее, потому что здесь может найтись кое-кто похитрее его. На
ночь запритесь от него на ключ. Если он будет буйствовать, мы увезем вас к вашей тетке в Харроу…
Ну, а теперь надо как можно лучше использовать время, и потому проводите нас, пожалуйста, в те
комнаты, которые мы должны обследовать.
Дом был из серого, покрытого лишайником камня и имел два полукруглых крыла, распростертых, словно клешни у краба, по обеим сторонам высокой центральной части. В одном из этих крыльев окна были выбиты и заколочены досками; крыша местами провалилась. Центральная часть казалась почти столь же разрушенной, зато правое крыло было сравнительно недавно отделано, и по
шторам на окнах, по голубоватым дымкам, которые вились из труб, видно было, что живут именно
здесь. У крайней стены были воздвигнуты леса, начаты кое-какие работы. Но ни одного каменщика
не было видно.
Холмс стал медленно расхаживать по нерасчищенной лужайке, внимательно глядя на окна.
– Насколько я понимаю, тут комната, в которой вы жили прежде. Среднее окно – из комнаты
вашей сестры, а третье окно, то, что поближе к главному зданию, – из комнаты доктора Ройлотта…
– Совершенно правильно. Но теперь я живу в средней комнате.
– Понимаю, из-за ремонта. Кстати, как-то незаметно, чтобы эта стена нуждалась в столь неотложном ремонте.
– Совсем не нуждается. Я думаю, это просто предлог, чтобы убрать меня из моей комнаты.
– Весьма вероятно. Итак, вдоль противоположной стены тянется коридор, куда выходят двери
всех трех комнат. В коридоре, без сомнения, есть окна?
– Да, но очень маленькие. Пролезть сквозь них невозможно.
– Так как вы обе запирались на ключ, то из коридора попасть к вам в комнаты нельзя. Будьте
любезны, пройдите в свою комнату и закройте ставни.
Мисс Стоунер исполнила его просьбу. Холмс предварительно осмотрев окно, употребил все
усилия, чтобы открыть ставни снаружи, но безуспешно: не было ни одной щелки, сквозь которую
можно было бы просунуть хоть лезвие ножа, чтобы поднять засов. При помощи лупы он осмотрел
петли, но они были из твердого железа и крепко вделаны в массивную стену.
– Гм! – проговорил он, в раздумье почесывая подбородок.
– Моя первоначальная гипотеза не подтверждается фактами. Когда ставни закрыты, в эти окна
не влезть… Ладно, посмотрим, не удастся ли нам выяснить что-нибудь, осмотрев комнаты изнутри.
Маленькая боковая дверь открывалась в выбеленный известкой коридор, в который выходили
двери всех трех спален. Холмс не счел нужным осматривать третью комнату, и мы сразу прошли во
вторую, где теперь спала мисс Стоунер и где умерла ее сестра. Это была просто обставленная комнатка с низким потолком и с широким камином, одним из тех, которые встречаются в старинных деревенских домах. В одном углу стоял комод; другой угол занимала узкая кровать, покрытая белым
одеялом; слева от окна находился туалетный столик. Убранство комнаты довершали два плетеных
стула да квадратный коврик посередине. Панели на стенах были из темного, источенного червями
дуба, такие древние и выцветшие, что казалось, их не меняли со времени постройки дома.
Холмс взял стул и молча уселся в углу. Глаза его внимательно скользили вверх и вниз по стенам, бегали вокруг комнаты, изучая и осматривая каждую мелочь.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Куда проведен этот звонок? – спросил он наконец указывая на висевший над кроватью толстый шнур от звонка, кисточка которого лежала на подушке.
– В комнату прислуги.
– Он как будто новее всех прочих вещей.
– Да, он проведен всего несколько лет назад.
– Вероятно, ваша сестра просила об этом?
– Нет, она никогда им не пользовалась. Мы всегда все делали сами.
– Действительно, здесь этот звонок – лишняя роскошь. Вы меня извините, если я задержу вас на
несколько минут: мне хочется хорошенько осмотреть пол.
С лупой в руках он ползал на четвереньках взад и вперед по полу, пристально исследуя каждую
трещину в половицах. Также тщательно он осмотрел и панели на стенах. Потом подошел к кровати,
внимательно оглядел ее и всю стену снизу доверху. Потом взял шнур от звонка и дернул его.
– Да ведь звонок поддельный! – сказал он.
– Он не звонит?
– Он даже не соединен с проволокой. Любопытно! Видите, он привязан к крючку как раз над
тем маленьким отверстием для вентилятора.
– Как странно! Я и не заметила этого.
– Очень странно… – бормотал Холмс, дергая шнур. – В этой комнате многое обращает на себя
внимание. Например, каким нужно быть безумным строителем, чтобы вывести вентилятор в соседнюю комнату, когда его с такой же легкостью можно было вывести наружу!
– Все это сделано тоже очень недавно, – сказала Элен.
– Примерно в одно время со звонком, – заметил Холмс.
– Да, как раз в то время здесь произвели кое-какие переделки.
– Интересные переделки: звонки, которые не звонят, и вентиляторы, которые не вентилируют.
С вашего позволения, мисс Стоунер, мы перенесем наши исследования в другие комнаты.
Комната доктора Гримеби Ройлотта была больше, чем комната его падчерицы, но обставлена
так же просто. Походная кровать, небольшая деревянная полка, уставленная книгами, преимущественно техническими, кресло рядом с кроватью, простой плетеный стул у стены, круглый стол и
большой железный несгораемый шкаф – вот и все, что бросалось в глаза при входе в комнату. Холмс
медленно похаживал вокруг, с живейшим интересом исследуя каждую вещь.
– Что здесь? – спросил он, стукнув по несгораемому шкафу.
– Деловые бумаги моего отчима.
– Ого! Значит, вы заглядывали в этот шкаф?
– Только раз, несколько лет назад. Я помню, там была кипа бумаг.
– А нет ли в нем, например, кошки?
– Нет. Что за странная мысль!
– А вот посмотрите!
«Well, look at this.»
Он снял со шкафа маленькое блюдце с молоком.
– Нет, кошек мы не держим. Но зато у нас есть гепард и павиан.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Ах, да! Гепард, конечно, всего только большая кошка, но сомневаюсь, что такое маленькое
блюдце молока может насытить этого зверя. Да, в этом надо разобраться.
Он присел на корточки перед стулом и принялся с глубоким вниманием изучать сиденье.
– Благодарю вас, все ясно, – сказал он, поднимаясь и кладя лупу в карман. – Ага, вот еще коечто весьма интересное!
Внимание его привлекла небольшая собачья плеть, висевшая в углу кровати. Конец ее был завязан петлей.
– Что вы об этом думаете, Уотсон?
– По-моему, самая обыкновенная плеть. Не понимаю, для чего понадобилось завязывать на ней
петлю.
– Не такая уж обыкновенная… Ах, сколько зла на свете, и хуже всего, когда злые дела совершает умный человек!.. Ну, с меня достаточно, мисс, я узнал все, что мне нужно, а теперь с вашего
разрешения мы пройдемся по лужайке.
Я никогда не видел Холмса таким угрюмым и насупленным. Некоторое время мы расхаживали
взад и вперед в глубоком молчании, и ни я, ни мисс Стоунер не прерывали течения его мыслей, пока
он сам не очнулся от задумчивости.
– Очень важно, мисс Стоунер, чтобы вы в точности следовали моим советам, – сказал он.
– Я исполню все беспрекословно.
– Обстоятельства слишком серьезны, и колебаться нельзя. От вашего полного повиновения зависит ваша жизнь.
– Я целиком полагаюсь на вас.
– Во-первых, мы оба – мой друг и я – должны провести ночь в вашей комнате.
Мисс Стоунер и я взглянули на него с изумлением.
– Это необходимо. Я вам объясню. Что это там, в той стороне? Вероятно, деревенская гостиница?
– Да, там «Корона».
– Очень хорошо. Оттуда видны ваши окна?
– Конечно.
– Когда ваш отчим вернется, скажите, что у вас болит голова, уйдите в свою комнату и запритесь на ключ. Услышав, что он пошел спать, вы снимете засов, откроете ставни вашего окна и поставите на подоконник лампу; эта лампа будет для нас сигналом. Тогда, захватив с собой все, что пожелаете, вы перейдете в свою бывшую комнату. Я убежден, что, несмотря на ремонт, вы можете один
раз переночевать в ней.
– Безусловно.
– Остальное предоставьте нам.
– Но что же вы собираетесь сделать?
– Мы проведем ночь в вашей комнате и выясним причину шума, напугавшего вас.
– Мне кажется, мистер Холмс, что вы уже пришли к какому-то выводу, – сказала мисс Стоунер,
дотрагиваясь до рукава моего друга.
– Быть может, да.
– Тогда, ради всего святого, скажите хотя бы, отчего умерла моя сестра?
– Прежде чем ответить, я хотел бы собрать более точные улики.
– Тогда скажите по крайней мере, верно ли мое предположение, что она умерла от внезапного
испуга?
– Нет, неверно: я полагаю, что причина ее смерти была более вещественна… А теперь, мисс
Стоунер, мы должны покинуть вас, потому что, если мистер Ройлотт вернется и застанет нас, вся поездка окажется совершенно напрасной. До свидания! Будьте мужественны, сделайте все, что я сказал,
и не сомневайтесь, что мы быстро устраним грозящую вам опасность.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Good-bye, and be brave.»
Мы с Шерлоком Холмсом без всяких затруднений сняли номер в гостинице «Корона». Номер
наш находился в верхнем этаже, и из окна видны были ворота парка и обитаемое крыло стокморонского дома. В сумерках мы видели, как мимо проехал доктор Гримеби Ройлотт; его грузное тело вздымалось горой рядом с тощей фигурой мальчишки, правившего экипажем. Мальчишке не сразу удалось открыть тяжелые железные ворота, и мы слышали, как рычал на него доктор, и видели, с
какой яростью он потрясал кулаками. Экипаж въехал в ворота, и через несколько минут сквозь деревья замелькал свет от лампы, зажженной в одной из гостиных. Мы сидели в потемках, не зажигая огня.
– Право, не знаю, – сказал Холмс, – брать ли вас сегодня ночью с собой! Дело-то очень опасное.
– А я могу быть полезен вам?
– Ваша помощь может оказаться неоценимой.
– Тогда я непременно пойду.
– Спасибо.
– Вы говорите об опасности. Очевидно, вы видели в этих комнатах что-то такое, чего не видел
я.
– Нет, я видел то же, что и вы, но сделал другие выводы.
– Я не заметил в комнате ничего примечательного, кроме шнура от звонка, но, признаюсь, не
способен понять, для какой цели он может служить.
– А на вентилятор вы обратили внимание?
– Да, но мне кажется, что в этом маленьком отверстии между двумя комнатами нет ничего необычного. Оно так мало, что даже мышь едва ли может пролезть сквозь него.
– Я знал об этом вентиляторе прежде, чем мы приехали в Сток-Морон.
– Дорогой мой Холмс!
– Да, знал. Помните, мисс Стоунер сказала, что ее сестра чувствовала запах сигар, которые курит доктор Ройлотт? А это доказывает, что между двумя комнатами есть отверстие, и, конечно, оно
очень мало, иначе его заметил бы следователь при осмотре комнаты. Я решил, что тут должен быть
вентилятор.
– Но какую опасность может таить в себе вентилятор?
– А посмотрите, какое странное совпадение: над кроватью устраивают вентилятор, вешают
шнур, и леди, спящая на кровати, умирает. Разве это не поражает вас?
– Я до сих пор не могу связать эти обстоятельства.
– А в кровати вы не заметили ничего особенного?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Нет.
– Она привинчена к полу. Вы когда-нибудь видели, чтобы кровати привинчивали к полу?
– Пожалуй, не видел.
– Леди не могла передвинуть свою кровать, ее кровать всегда оставалась в одном и том же положении по отношению к вентилятору и шнуру. Этот звонок приходится называть просто шнуром,
так как он не звонит.
– Холмс! – вскричал я. – Кажется, я начинаю понимать, на что вы намекаете. Значит, мы явились как раз вовремя, чтобы предотвратить ужасное и утонченное преступление.
– Да, утонченное и ужасное. Когда врач совершает преступление, он опаснее всех прочих преступников. У него крепкие нервы и большие знания. Палмер и Причард22 были лучшими специалистами в своей области. Этот человек очень хитер, но я надеюсь, Уотсон, что нам удастся перехитрить
его. Сегодня ночью нам предстоит пережить немало страшного, и потому, прошу вас, давайте пока
спокойно закурим трубки и проведем эти несколько часов, разговаривая о чем-нибудь более веселом.
Часов около девяти свет, видневшийся между деревьями, погас, и усадьба погрузилась во тьму.
Так прошло часа два, и вдруг ровно в одиннадцать одинокий яркий огонек засиял прямо против нашего окна.
– Это сигнал для нас, – сказал Холмс, вскакивая. – Свет горит в среднем окне.
Выходя, он сказал хозяину гостиницы, что мы идем в гости к одному знакомому и, возможно,
там и переночуем. Через минуту мы вышли на темную дорогу. Свежий ветер дул нам в лицо, желтый
свет, мерцая перед нами во мраке, указывал путь.
Попасть к дому было нетрудно, потому что старая парковая ограда обрушилась во многих местах. Пробираясь между деревьями, мы достигли лужайки, пересекли ее и уже собирались влезть в
окно, как вдруг какое-то существо, похожее на отвратительного урода-ребенка, выскочило из лавровых кустов, бросилось, корчась, на траву, а потом промчалось через лужайку и скрылось в темноте.
– Боже! – прошептал я. – Вы видели?
В первое мгновение Холмс испугался не меньше меня. Он схватил мою руку и сжал ее, словно
тисками. Потом тихо рассмеялся и, приблизив губы к моему уху, пробормотал еле слышно:
– Милая семейка! Ведь это павиан.
Я совсем забыл о любимцах доктора. А гепард, который каждую минуту может оказаться у нас
на плечах? Признаться, я почувствовал себя значительно лучше, когда, следуя примеру Холмса,
сбросил ботинки, влез в окно и очутился в спальне. Мой друг бесшумно закрыл ставни, переставил
лампу на стол и быстро оглядел комнату. Здесь было все как днем. Он приблизился ко мне и, сложив
руку трубкой, прошептал так тихо, что я едва понял его:
– Малейший звук погубит нас.
Я кивнул головой, показывая, что слышу.
– Нам придется сидеть без огня. Сквозь вентилятор он может заметить свет.
Я кивнул еще раз.
– Не засните – от этого зависит ваша жизнь. Держите револьвер наготове. Я сяду на край кровати, а вы на стул.
Я вытащил револьвер и положил его на угол стола. Холмс принес с собой длинную, тонкую
трость и поместил ее возле себя на кровать вместе с коробкой спичек и огарком свечи. Потом задул
лампу, и мы остались в полной темноте.
Забуду ли я когда-нибудь эту страшную бессонную ночь! Ни один звук не доносился до меня. Я
не слышал даже дыхания своего друга, а между тем знал, что он сидит в двух шагах от меня с открытыми глазами, в таком же напряженном, нервном состоянии, как и я. Ставни не пропускали ни малейшего луча света, мы сидели в абсолютной тьме. Изредка снаружи доносился крик ночной птицы,
а раз у самого нашего окна раздался протяжный вой, похожий на кошачье мяуканье: гепард, видимо,
гулял на свободе. Слышно было, как вдалеке церковные часы гулко отбивали четверти. Какими долгими они казались нам, эти каждые пятнадцать минут! Пробило двенадцать, час, два, три, а мы все
сидели молча, ожидая чего-то неизбежного.
Внезапно у вентилятора мелькнул свет и сразу же исчез, но тотчас мы почувствовали сильный
запах горелого масла и накаленного металла. Кто-то в соседней комнате зажег потайной фонарь. Я

услышал, как что-то двинулось, потом все смолкло, и только запах стал еще сильнее. С полчаса я сидел, напряженно вглядываясь в темноту. Внезапно послышался какой-то новый звук, нежный и тихий, словно вырывалась из котла тонкая струйка пара. И в то же мгновение Холмс вскочил с кровати,
чиркнул спичкой и яростно хлестнул своей тростью по шнуру.
– Вы видите ее, Уотсон? – проревел он. – Видите?
Но я ничего не видел. Пока Холмс чиркал спичкой, я слышал тихий отчетливый свист, но внезапный яркий свет так ослепил мои утомленные глаза, что я не мог ничего разглядеть и не понял, почему Холмс так яростно хлещет тростью. Однако я успел заметить выражение ужаса и отвращения
на его мертвенно-бледном лице.
Holmes lashed furiously.
Холмс перестал хлестать и начал пристально разглядывать вентилятор, как вдруг тишину ночи
прорезал такой ужасный крик, какого я не слышал никогда в жизни. Этот хриплый крик, в котором
смешались страдание, страх и ярость, становился все громче и громче. Рассказывали потом, что не
только в деревне, но даже в отдаленном домике священника крик этот разбудил всех спящих. Похолодевшие от ужаса, мы глядели друг на друга, пока последний вопль не замер в тишине.
– Что это значит? – спросил я, задыхаясь.
– Это значит, что все кончено, – ответил Холмс. – И в сущности, это к лучшему. Возьмите револьвер, и пойдем в комнату доктора Ройлотта.
Лицо его было сурово. Он зажег лампу и пошел по коридору. Дважды он стукнул в дверь комнаты доктора, но изнутри никто не ответил. Тогда он повернул ручку и вошел в комнату. Я шел следом за ним, держа в руке заряженный револьвер.
Необычайное зрелище представилось нашим взорам. На столе стоял фонарь, бросая яркий луч
света на железный несгораемый шкаф, дверца которого была полуоткрыта. У стола на соломенном
стуле сидел доктор Гримиби Ройлотт в длинном сером халате, из-под которого виднелись голые лодыжки. Ноги его были в красных турецких туфлях без задников. На коленях лежала та самая плеть,
которую мы еще днем заметили в его комнате. Он сидел, задрав подбородок кверху, неподвижно
устремив глаза в потолок; в глазах застыло выражение страха. Вокруг его головы туго обвилась какая-то необыкновенная, желтая с коричневыми крапинками лента. При нашем появлении доктор не
шевельнулся и не издал ни звука.
– Лента! Пестрая лента! – прошептал Холмс.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He made neither sound nor motion.
Я сделал шаг вперед. В то же мгновение странный головной убор зашевелился, и из волос доктора Ройлотта поднялась граненая головка и раздувшаяся шея ужасной змеи.
– Болотная гадюка! – вскричал Холмс. – Самая смертоносная индийская змея! Он умер через
девять секунд после укуса. «Поднявший меч от меча и погибнет», и тот, кто роет другому яму, сам в
нее попадет. Посадим эту тварь в ее логово, отправим мисс Стоунер в какое-нибудь спокойное место
и дадим знать полиции о том, что случилось.
Он схватил плеть с колен мертвого, накинул петлю на голову змеи, стащил ее с ужасного насеста, швырнул внутрь несгораемого шкафа и захлопнул дверцу.
Таковы истинные обстоятельства смерти доктора Гримсби Ройлотта из Сток-Морона. Не стану
подробно рассказывать, как мы сообщили печальную новость испуганной девушке, как утренним поездом мы препроводили ее на попечение тетки в Харроу и как туповатое полицейское следствие
пришло к заключению, что доктор погиб от собственной неосторожности, забавляясь со своей любимицей – ядовитой змеей. Остальное Шерлок Холмс рассказал мне, когда мы на следующий день ехали обратно.
– В начале я пришел к совершенно неправильным выводам, мой дорогой Уотсон, – сказал он, –
и это доказывает, как опасно опираться на неточные данные. Присутствие цыган, восклицание несчастной девушки, пытавшейся объяснить, что она увидела, чиркнув спичкой, – всего этого было достаточно, чтобы навести меня на ложный след. Но когда мне стало ясно, что в комнату невозможно проникнуть ни через дверь, ни через окно, что не оттуда грозит опасность обитателю этой комнаты, я
понял свою ошибку, и это может послужить мне оправданием. Я уже говорил вам, внимание мое сразу привлекли вентилятор и шнур от звонка, висящий над кроватью. Когда обнаружилось, что звонок
фальшивый, а кровать прикреплена к полу, у меня зародилось подозрение, что шнур служит лишь
мостом, соединяющим вентилятор с кроватью. Мне сразу же пришла мысль о змее, а зная, как доктор
любит окружать себя всевозможными индийскими тварями, я понял, что, пожалуй, угадал. Только
такому хитрому, жестокому злодею, прожившему много лет на Востоке могло прийти в голову прибегнуть к яду, который нельзя обнаружить химическим путем. В пользу этого яда, с его точки зрения,
говорило и то, что он действует мгновенно. Следователь должен был бы обладать поистине необыкновенно острым зрением, чтобы разглядеть два крошечных темных пятнышка, оставленных зубами
змеи. Потом я вспомнил о свисте. Свистом доктор звал змею обратно, чтобы ее не увидели на рассвете рядом с мертвой. Вероятно, давая ей молоко, он приучил ее возвращаться к нему. Змею он пропускал через вентилятор в самый глухой час ночи и знал наверняка, что она поползет по шнуру и спустится на кровать. Рано или поздно девушка должна была стать жертвой ужасного замысла, змея
ужалила бы ее, если не сейчас, то через неделю. Я пришел к этим выводам еще до того, как посетил
комнату доктора Ройлотта. Когда же я исследовал сиденье его стула, я понял, что у доктора была
привычка становиться на стул, чтобы достать до вентилятора. А когда я увидел несгораемый шкаф,
блюдце с молоком и плеть, мои последние сомнения окончательно рассеялись. Металлический лязг,
который слышала мисс Стоунер, был, очевидно, стуком дверцы несгораемого шкафа, куда доктор
прятал змею. Вам известно, что я предпринял, убедившись в правильности своих выводов. Как только я услышал шипение змеи – вы, конечно, тоже слыхали его, – я немедленно зажег свет и начал сте-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
гать ее тростью.
– Вы прогнали ее назад в вентилятор…
–…и тем самым заставил напасть на хозяина. Удары моей трости разозлили ее, в ней проснулась змеиная злоба, и она напала на первого попавшегося ей человека. Таким образом, я косвенно
виновен в смерти доктора Гримеби Ройлотта, но не могу сказать, чтобы эта вина тяжким бременем
легла на мою совесть.

Из всех задач, какие приходилось решать моему другу мистеру Шерлоку Холмсу, мною его
вниманию было предложено лишь две, а именно: случай, когда мистер Хэдерли лишился большого
пальца, и происшествие с обезумевшим полковником Уорбэртоном. Последняя представляла собой
обширное поле деятельности для тонкого и самобытного наблюдателя, зато первая оказалась столь
своеобразной и столь драматичной по своим подробностям, что скорее заслуживает изложения в моих записках, хотя и не позволила моему приятелю применить те дедуктивные методы мышления,
благодаря которым он неоднократно добивался таких примечательных результатов. Об этой истории,
мне помнится, не раз писали газеты, но, как и все подобные события, втиснутая в газетный столбец,
она казалась значительно менее увлекательной, нежели тогда, когда ее рассказывал участник событий, и действие как бы медленно развертывалось перед нашими глазами, и мы шаг за шагом проникали в тайну и приближались к истине. В свое время обстоятельства этого дела произвели на меня
глубокое впечатление, и прошедшие с тех пор два года ничуть не ослабили этот эффект.
События, о которых я хочу рассказать, произошли летом 1889 года, вскоре после моей женитьбы. Я снова занялся врачебной практикой и навсегда распрощался с квартирой на Бейкер-стрит, хотя
часто навещал Холмса и время от времени даже убеждал отказаться от богемных привычек и почаще
приходить к нам. Практика моя неуклонно росла, а поскольку я жил неподалеку от Паддингтона, то
среди пациентов у меня было несколько служащих этого вокзала. Один из них, которого мне удалось
вылечить от тяжелой, изнурительной болезни, без устали рекламировал мои достоинства и посылал
ко мне каждого страждущего, кого он был способен уговорить обратиться к врачу.
Однажды утром, часов около семи, меня разбудила, постучав в дверь, наша служанка. Она сказала, что с Паддингтона пришли двое мужчин и ждут меня в кабинете. Я быстро оделся, зная по опыту, что несчастные случаи на железной дороге редко бывают пустячными, и сбежал вниз. Из приемной, плотно прикрыв за собой дверь, вышел мой старый пациент – кондуктор.
– Он здесь, – прошептал он, указывая на дверь. – Все в порядке.
– Кто? – не понял я. По его шепоту можно было подумать, что он запер у меня в кабинете какое-то необыкновенное существо.
– Новый пациент, – так же шепотом продолжал он. – Я решил, что лучше сам приведу его, тогда ему не сбежать. Он там, все в порядке. А мне пора. У меня, доктор, как и у вас, свои обязанности.
И он ушел, мой верный поклонник, не дав мне даже возможности поблагодарить его.
Я вошел в приемную; возле стола сидел человек. Он был одет в недорогой костюм из пестротканого твида; кепка его лежала на моих книгах. Одна рука у него была обвязана носовым платком
сплошь в пятнах крови. Он был молод, лет двадцати пяти, не больше, с выразительным мужественным лицом, но страшно бледен и словно чем-то потрясен – он был совершенно не в силах овладеть
собою.
– Извините, что так рано потревожил вас, доктор, – сказал он, – но со мной нынче ночью произошло нечто серьезное. Я приехал в Лондон утренним поездом, и, когда начал узнавать в Паддинг-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
тоне, где найти врача, этот добрый человек любезно проводил меня к вам. Я дал служанке свою карточку, но, вижу, она оставила ее на столе.
Я взял карточку и прочел имя, род занятий и адрес моего посетителя: «Мистер Виктор Хэдерли,
инженер-гидравлик. Виктория-стрит, 16-а (4-й этаж)».
– Очень сожалею, что заставил вас ждать, – сказал я, усаживаясь в кресло у письменного стола. – Вы ведь всю ночь ехали – занятие само по себе не из веселых.
– О, эту ночь скучной я никак не могу назвать, – ответил он и расхохотался.
Откинувшись на спинку стула, он весь трясся от смеха, и в его смехе звучала какая-то высокая,
звенящая нота. Мне, как медику, его смех не понравился.
– Прекратите! Возьмите себя в руки! – крикнул я и налил ему воды из графина.
Но и это не помогло. Им овладел один из тех истерических припадков, которые случаются у
сильных натур, когда переживания уже позади. Наконец смех утомил его, и он несколько успокоился.
– Я веду себя крайне глупо, – задыхаясь, вымолвил он.
– Вовсе нет. Выпейте это! – Я плеснул в воду немного коньяку, и его бледные щеки порозовели.
– Спасибо, – поблагодарил он. – А теперь, доктор, будьте добры посмотреть мой палец, или,
лучше сказать, то место, где он когда-то был.
Он снял платок и протянул руку. Даже я, привычный к такого рода зрелищам, содрогнулся. На
руке торчало только четыре пальца, а на месте большого было страшное красное вздутие. Палец был
оторван или отрублен у самого основания.
He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.
– Боже мой! – воскликнул я. – Какая ужасная рана! Крови, наверное, вытекло предостаточно.
– Да. После удара я упал в обморок и, наверное, был без сознания очень долго. Очнувшись, я
увидел, что кровь все еще идет, тогда я туго завязал платок вокруг запястья и закрутил узел щепкой.
– Превосходно! Из вас вышел бы хороший хирург.
– Да нет, просто я разбираюсь в том, что имеет отношение к гидравлике.
– Рана нанесена тяжелым и острым инструментом, – сказал я, осматривая руку.
– Похожим на нож мясника, – добавил он.
– Надеюсь, случайно?
– Никоим образом.
– Неужели покушение?
– Вот именно.
– Не пугайте меня.
Я промыл и обработал рану, а затем укутал руку ватой и перевязал пропитанными корболкой
бинтами. Он сидел, откинувшись на спинку стула, и ни разу не поморщился, хотя время от времени
закусывал губы.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Ну, как? – закончив, спросил я.
– Превосходно! После вашего коньяка и перевязки я словно заново родился. Я очень ослабел,
ведь мне пришлось немало испытать.
– Может, лучше не говорить о случившемся? Вы будете волноваться.
– О нет. Сейчас уже нет. Все равно придется выкладывать всю историю в полиции. Но, между
нами говоря, только моя рана может заставить их поверить моему заявлению. История эта совершенно необычная, а я ничем подтвердить ее не могу. Даже если мне поверят, доводы, которые я способен
представить в доказательство ее, настолько неопределенны, что вряд ли здесь восторжествует правосудие.
– Значит, это загадка, которую нужно разрешить, – воскликнул я. – Тогда я настоятельно рекомендую вам, прежде чем обращаться в полицию, пойти к моему другу мистеру Шерлоку Холмсу.
– Я слышал об этом человеке, – ответил мой пациент, – и был бы очень рад, если бы он взял это
дело на себя, хотя, разумеется, все равно придется заявить в полицию. Может, вы порекомендуете
меня ему?
– Больше того, я сам отвезу вас к нему.
– Премного буду вам обязан.
– Давайте вызовем экипаж и поедем. Мы как раз поспеем к завтраку. Вы в состоянии ехать?
– Да. На душе у меня будет неспокойно до тех пор, пока я не расскажу мою историю.
– Тогда я попрошу служанку вызвать кэб и через минуту буду готов.
Я побежал наверх, в нескольких словах рассказал о случившемся жене и через пять минут вместе с моим новым знакомым уже ехал по направлению к Бейкер-стрит.
Как я и предполагал, Шерлок Холмс – еще в халате – сидел в гостиной, читал ту колонку из
«Таймса», в которой публикуются сведения о розыске различных лиц, и курил трубку. Эту трубку он
обычно выкуривал до завтрака, набивая всякими остатками всех табаков – они с особой тщательностью собирались и сушились на каминной доске. Он принял нас с присущим ему спокойствием и радушием, заказал для нас яичницу с ветчиной, и мы на славу позавтракали. Когда с едой было покончено, он усадил нашего нового знакомого на диван, подложил ему под спину подушку, а рядом
поставил стакан воды с коньяком.
He settled our new acquaintance on the sofa.
– Вам, видно, пришлось пережить нечто необычное, мистер Хэдерли, – сказал он. – Прошу вас
прилечь на диван и чувствовать себя как дома. Рассказывайте, пока сможете, но, если почувствуете
себя плохо, помолчите и попробуйте восстановить силы при помощи вот этого легкого средства.
– Благодарю вас, – ответил мой пациент, – но я чувствую себя другим человеком после того,
как доктор перевязал мне руку, а ваш завтрак, по-видимому, завершил курс лечения. Я постараюсь
недолго занимать у вас драгоценное время и поэтому тотчас же приступаю к рассказу о моих удивительных приключениях.
Опустив тяжелые веки, будто от усталости – что на самом деле лишь скрывало присущее ему
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
жадное любопытство, – Холмс поудобнее уселся в кресло, я пристроился напротив, и мы принялись
слушать действительно невероятную историю, которую наш посетитель изложил во всех подробностях.
– Должен сказать вам, – начал он, – что родители мои умерли, я не женат и потому живу совершенно один в своей лондонской квартире. По профессии я инженер-гидравлик и приобрел немалый опыт в течение тех семи лет, что пробыл в подручных в известной гринвичской фирме «Веннер
и Мейтсон». Два года назад, унаследовав солидную сумму денег после смерти отца, я решил завести
собственное дело и открыл контору на Виктория-стрит.
Наверное, каждому, кто открывает собственное дело, сначала приходится туго. Во всяком случае, так было со мной. В течение двух лет мне довелось дать всего три консультации и выполнить
одну небольшую работу – вот и все, что дала мне моя специальность. Весь мой доход составляет на
сегодняшний день двадцать семь фунтов десять шиллингов. Ежедневно с девяти утра до четырех я
сидел в своей захудалой конторе и наконец о тяжелым сердцем начал понимать, что у меня не будет
настоящей работы.
Но вот вчера, когда я собрался было уходить, вошел мой клерк, доложил, что меня желает видеть по делу какой-то джентльмен, и подал мне визитную карточку: «Полковник Лизандер Старк». А
следом в комнату вошел и сам полковник, человек роста выше среднего, но чрезвычайно худой. До
сих пор мне не доводилось встречать таких худых людей. Кожа так обтягивала выпирающие скулы,
что лицо его, казалось, состояло лишь из носа и подбородка. Тем не менее худым он был по природе,
а не от какой-либо болезни, ибо взгляд у него сверкал, двигался он проворно и держался уверенно.
Он был просто, но аккуратно одет, а по возрасту, решил я, ему под сорок.
Colonel Lysander Stark.
– Мистер Хэдерли? – спросил он с немецким акцентом. – Вас порекомендовали мне как человека не только опытного, но и скромного, умеющего хранить тайну.
Я поклонился, чувствуя себя польщенным, как и всякий молодой человек при обращении подобного рода.
– Разрешите узнать, кто дал мне такую лестную характеристику? – полюбопытствовал я.
– Я предпочитаю пока умолчать об этом. Из того же источника мне стало известно, что родители ваши умерли, вы холосты и живете в Лондоне один.
– Совершенно правильно, – ответил я, – но простите, я не совсем понимаю, какое это имеет отношение к моей деятельности. Вы ведь желали увидеть меня по делу?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Именно так. Вы сейчас убедитесь, что все, о чем я говорю, имеет непосредственное отношение к делу. Я хочу поручить вам одну работу, но при этом должна сохраняться полная тайна, полная
тайна, понятно? Чего, разумеется, можно скорее ожидать от человека одинокого, нежели от человека,
который живет в кругу семьи.
– Если я дам слово хранить тайну, – сказал я, – можете быть уверены, я его не нарушу.
Он пристально посмотрел на меня, и я подумал, что ни разу не видел столь подозрительного и
недоверчивого взгляда.
– Итак, вы обещаете? – спросил он.
– Да, обещаю.
– Обещаете хранить полное молчание до, во время и после работы? Никогда не упоминать об
этом деле ни устно, ни письменно?
– Я уже дал вам слово.
– Очень хорошо.
Вдруг он вскочил и, молнией метнувшись по комнате, распахнул дверь настежь. За дверью никого не было.
– Все в порядке, – заметил он, возвращаясь на место. – Известно, как клерки порой интересуются делами своих хозяев. Теперь можем поговорить спокойно.
Он подвинул свой стул вплотную к моему и уставился на меня тем же недоверчивопронзительным взглядом.
Чувство отвращения и что-то похожее на страх начало расти во мне при столь странном поведении этого чересчур худого человека. Даже боязнь потерять клиента не могла заставить меня терпеливо ждать, пока он заговорит.
– Прошу вас, сэр, изложить дело, я дорожу своим временем.
Да простит мне небо эти слова, но они сами сорвались с моих уст.
– Вас устроят пятьдесят гиней за одну ночь работы? – спросил он.
– Вполне.
– Я сказал – за ночь работы, но правильнее сказать – за час. Мне просто нужно ваше мнение по
поводу гидравлического пресса, который вышел из строя. Если вы подскажете, в чем дело, мы сумеем сами устранить неисправность. Что скажете?
– Дело несложное, плата хороша.
– Именно так. Нам хотелось бы, чтобы вы приехали сегодня вечером последним поездом.
– Куда?
– В Айфорд. Это небольшая деревушка в Брекшире, на границе с Оксфордширом, в семи милях
от Рединга. От Паддингтона есть поезд, который прибывает туда примерно в одиннадцать пятнадцать.
– Превосходно.
– Я приеду в экипаже встретить вас.
– Значит, придется добираться на лошадях?
– Да, наш дом находится в стороне от железной дороги. От Айфорд до него добрых семь миль.
– Значит, вряд ли мы доберемся до места к полуночи. И обратного поезда уже не будет. Мне
придется провести у вас всю ночь.
– Что же, это не проблема.
– Но не очень-то удобно. А не мог бы я приехать в какое-нибудь другое, более подходящее
время?
– Самое лучшее, считаем мы, если вы приедете поздно вечером. Именно за неудобства мы и
платим вам, никому не известному молодому человеку, сумму, за которую можем получить совет
самых крупных специалистов по вашей профессии. Конечно, если предложение вам не по душе, еще
есть время от него отказаться.
Я подумал, как мне пригодятся пятьдесят гиней.
– Нет, нет, – заспешил я, – я готов сделать так, как вы считаете нужным. Однако мне хотелось
бы более четко представить себе, что именно от меня требуется.
– Совершенно справедливо. Обещание хранить тайну; которое мы взяли с вас, вполне естественно, возбудило ваше любопытство. Я отнюдь не хочу, чтобы вы брали какие-то обязательства, не
ознакомившись предварительно со всеми деталями. Надеюсь, нас никто не подслушивает?
– Никто.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Дело обстоит следующим образом. Вам, вероятно известно, что сукновальная глина – довольно ценное сыры и что залежи ее в Англии встречаются в одном-двух местах.
– Я слышал об этом.
– Некоторое время назад я купил маленький участок земли, совсем крохотный, в десяти милях
от Рединга. И вдруг оказалось, что мне повезло: я обнаружил на одном поле пласт сукновальной глины. Я исследовал его и выяснил, что он составляет лишь небольшую перемычку, соединяющую два
очень мощных пласта слева и справа, расположенных на участках моих соседей. В их земле хранится
сырье не менее ценное, чем золото, а эти добрые люди пребывают в полном неведении. Мне, естественно, было бы выгодно купить у них землю, прежде чем они узнают ее истинную стоимость, но, к
сожалению, я не располагаю для этого достаточным капиталом. Поэтому я посвятил в тайну нескольких своих приятелей, и они предложили потихоньку, не говоря никому ни слова, разрабатывать наш
собственный небольшой пласт, чтобы заработать деньги, а впоследствии купить землю у соседей.
Этим мы и заняты вот уже некоторое время и в помощь установили гидравлический пресс. Но пресс,
как я уже сказал, вышел из строя, и нам нужен ваш совет. Мы ревностно храним наш секрет, и если
станет известно, что к нам приезжал гидравлик, то тотчас же начнутся расспросы, факты выплывут
наружу, и тогда прощай соседские поля, а с ними и наши планы. Вот почему я взял с вас слово никому не рассказывать, что вы сегодня вечером едете в Айфорд. Надеюсь, теперь все ясно?
– Единственное, что мне не совсем ясно, – ответил я, – это зачем вам гидравлический пресс.
Сукновальную глину, насколько я знаю, вычерпывают, как песок из карьера.
– А, – небрежно махнул он рукой, – у нас свои методы работы. Чтобы соседи ничего не заметили, мы прессуем глину в кирпичи. Но это деталь. Я доверяю вам, мистер Хэдерли, и рассказал все. –
Он встал. – Итак, жду вас в Айфорде в 23:15.
– Я обязательно приеду.
– И помните: никому ни слова.
Он еще раз посмотрел на меня долгим вопросительным взглядом и, пожав мне руку своей холодной, влажной рукой, поспешно вышел.
«Not a word to a soul!»
Хладнокровно поразмыслив, я, как вы представляете, не мог все-таки отделаться от удивления
по поводу этого странного поручения. С одной стороны, я, разумеется, был рад, ибо плату мне предложили в десять раз большую, чем та, которую запросил бы я сам. Кроме того, есть надежда, что за
этим поручением последуют и другие. С другой стороны, облик и манеры моего клиента произвели
на меня такое гнетущее впечатление, что я не мог отвязаться от мысли, что вся эта история с сукновальной глиной не вполне объясняет необходимость приехать непременно в полночь и избежать ог-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ласки. Однако я отбросил от себя страхи, на славу поужинал, доехал до Паддингтона и отправился в
путь.
В Рединге мне пришлось сделать пересадку. Но я успел на последний поезд в Айфорд и в начале двенадцатого прибыл на маленькую, тускло освещенную станцию. Я оказался единственным, кто
там сошел, на платформе не было ни души, кроме заспанного носильщика с фонарем в руках. За
станционной оградой я увидел моего утреннего знакомого – он стоял в тени на противоположной
стороне. Не сказав ни слова, он схватил меня за руку и втащил в экипаж, дверца которого предусмотрительно оказалась открытой. Опустив с обеих сторон окошки, полковник постучал кучеру, и лошадь
рванулась вперед.
– Одна лошадь? – перебил Холмс.
– Да одна.
– Вы не заметили масть?
– Заметил при свете фонаря, когда садился в экипаж. Лошадь рыжей масти.
– Усталая или свежая?
– Свежая, шерсть у нее лоснилась.
– Благодарю. Извините, что перебил. Прошу продолжать ваше весьма интересное повествование.
– Итак, мы тронулись в путь и ехали по меньшей мере с час. Полковник Лизандер Старк сказал,
что до места всего семь миль, но, если принять во внимание скорость, с какой мы мчались, и время,
что нам потребовалось, мне показалось, что расстояние там, должно быть, миль в двенадцать. Он
молча сидел рядом, и я чувствовал, когда поглядывал на него, что он не спускает с меня глаз. Проселочные дороги в тех местах, по-видимому, в неважном состоянии, и нас ужасно кидало из стороны в
сторону. Я попытался было в окошко разглядеть, где мы едем, но сквозь матовое стекло мог различить только мелькавшие кое-где световые пятна. Несколько раз я хотел завести разговор – уж очень
монотонным было наше путешествие, но полковник отвечал односложно, и разговор быстро затухал.
Наконец ямы и ухабы закончились, колеса захрустели по посыпанной гравием дорожке, и экипаж остановился. Полковник Лизандер Старк спрыгнул на землю, я последовал за ним, и он тут же потащил
меня на крыльцо, где зияла отворенная дверь. Таким образом, прямо из экипажа я очутился в прихожей и не сумел даже краем глаза разглядеть фасад дома. Едва я переступил порог, дверь тяжело захлопнулась за нами, и я услышал слабый стук отъезжающего экипажа.
В доме царил полный мрак, и полковник, что-то бормоча себе под нос, принялся шарить по
карманам в поисках спичек. Внезапно в дальнем конце коридора дверь отворилась, и в коридор упал
длинный луч золотистого света. Луч становился шире и шире, и в дверях, держа высоко над головой
лампу, появилась женщина; вытянув шею, она вглядывалась в нас. Я заметил, что она очень красивая, а блеск, которым отливало ее темное платье, свидетельствовал о том, что оно из дорогого материала. Она произнесла несколько слов на каком-то языке, и по тону я догадался, что она о чем-то
спросила моего попутчика, но тот лишь сердито буркнул в ответ, и она так вздрогнула, что чуть не
выронила лампу. Полковник Старк подошел к ней, шепнул что-то на ухо и, проводив обратно в комнату, вернулся ко мне с лампой в руках.
– Будьте добры подождать несколько минут здесь, – сказал он, отворяя другую дверь в незатейливо убранную комнатку с круглым столом посредине, на котором лежало несколько немецких книг.
Полковник Старк поставил лампу на крышку фисгармонии рядом с дверью. – Я постараюсь не задержать вас, – добавил он и исчез в темноте.
Я посмотрел книги на столе и, хотя не знаю немецкого, все же понял, что две из них были научные, а остальные – сборники поэзии. Затем я подошел к окну в надежде разглядеть, где нахожусь,
но оно было плотно прикрыто дубовыми ставнями. Удивительно молчаливый дом! Кругом царила
мертвая тишина, лишь где-то в коридоре громко тикали часы.
Смутное чувство тревоги овладевало мною. Кто эти немцы и что они делают в этом странном,
уединенном доме? И где находится сам дом? Милях в десяти от Айфорда – вот и все, что мне было
известно, но к северу, югу, востоку или западу от него, я и представления не имел. Однако неподалеку от Айфорда находится и Рединг и, наверное, другие города, так что место это не может быть очень
уж уединенным. Все же царившая вокруг полная тишина ясно давала понять, что мы в деревне. Я ходил взад и вперед по комнате, мурлыкая что-то себе под нос, чтобы окончательно не упасть духом, и
размышляя, что недаром получу обещанные пятьдесят гиней.
И вдруг беззвучно и медленно отворилась дверь, и в темном проеме появилась та женщина.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Желтый свет от моей лампы упал на ее красивое лицо. Я понял, что она чего-то боится, и мне самому
стало страшно. Дрожащим пальцем она подала мне знак хранить молчание и прошептала что-то на
ломаном английском языке, то и дело косясь назад во мрак, словно напуганная лошадь.
– Я уйду, – сказала она, очевидно, изо всех сил стараясь говорить спокойно. – Я уйду. Я не могу
оставаться здесь. И вам здесь тоже нечего делать.
– Сударыня, – возразил я, – я ведь еще не выполнил того, ради чего приехал. Я не могу уехать,
пока не осмотрю пресс.
– Не нужно медлить, – настаивала она. – Уходите в эту дверь. Там никого нет. – Видя, что я
лишь улыбаюсь и качаю головой, она вдруг отбросила всю свою сдержанность и, стиснув руки, шагнула ко мне. – Во имя неба, – прошептала она, – уходите отсюда, пока не поздно.
«Get away from here before it is too late!»
Но я довольно упрям по характеру, и, когда на пути у меня возникает какое-нибудь препятствие, я загораюсь еще больше и хочу довести дело до конца. Я подумал об обещанных пятидесяти гинеях, об утомительном путешествии и о тех неудобствах, что меня ожидают, если мне придется провести ночь на станции. Значит, все впустую? Почему я должен уехать, не выполнив работы и не
получив тех денег, которые мне должны? Может, эта женщина – ведь я ничего о ней не знаю – помешанная? С самым независимым видом, хотя, признаться, ее поведение напугало меня больше, чем
хотелось бы показать, я снова покачал головой и заявил о своем намерении остаться. Она было принялась уговаривать меня, но где-то наверху стукнула дверь, и послышались шаги на лестнице. На
мгновение она прислушалась, а потом, заломив в отчаянии руки, исчезла так же внезапно и бесшумно, как и появилась.
В комнату вошли полковник Лизандер Старк и маленький толстый человек с седой бородой,
торчащей из складок его двойного подбородка. Его представили мне как мистера Фергюсона.
– Это мой секретарь и управляющий, – сказал полковник.
– Между прочим, мне казалось, что, уходя, я закрыл эту дверь. Вас не просквозило?
– Наоборот, – возразил я, – это я приоткрыл дверь, в комнате душновато.
Полковник вновь нацелился на меня подозрительным взглядом.
– Пора перейти к делу, – сказал он. – Мы с мистером Фергюсоном покажем вам, где стоит
пресс.
– Я, пожалуй, надену шляпу.
– Зачем? Пресс находится в доме.
– Что? Разве залежи сукновальной глины здесь в доме?
– Нет-нет! Мы только прессуем здесь. Да, собственно, какая разница? Нам нужно, чтобы вы по-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
смотрели машину и сказали, в чем неисправность.
Мы поднялись наверх, впереди полковник с лампой, за ним толстяк-управляющий, а потом я.
Это был не дом, а настоящий лабиринт – с бесчисленными коридорами, галереями, узкими винтовыми лестницами и низкими дверцами, пороги которых были истоптаны ногами многих поколений. На
первом этаже не было ни ковров, ни мебели, со стен сыпалась штукатурка, и зелеными пятнами проступала сырость. Я старался сделать вид, что все это меня мало трогает, но отнюдь не забывал предостережения женщины – хоть и пренебрег им – и зорко следил за своими спутниками. Фергюсон
был угрюм и молчалив, но по тем нескольким словам, что он произнес, я понял, что он по крайней
мере уроженец Англии.
Наконец полковник Лизандер Старк остановился и отпер какую-то дверь. Она вела в маленькую квадратную комнату, в которой мы трое вряд ли могли поместиться. Фергюсон остался в коридоре, а мы с полковником вошли в комнату.
– Мы находимся сейчас, – сказал он, – внутри гидравлического пресса, и если бы кто-нибудь
включил его, нам не сдобровать. Потолок этой камеры в действительности – плоскость рабочего
поршня, который с силой, равной весу нескольких тонн, опускается на металлический пол. Снаружи
установлены боковые цилиндры, в которые поступает вода, она действует на поршень… Впрочем, с
механикой вы знакомы. Пресс работает, но что-то заедает, и он не развивает полную мощность.
Будьте добры осмотреть его и подсказать нам, что следует исправить.
Я взял у него лампу и внимательно осмотрел пресс. Это была машина гигантских размеров,
способная создавать огромное давление. Когда я вышел из камеры я включил рычаги управления,
где-то зашипело, и я понял, что в боковом цилиндре имеется небольшая утечка. Осмотр показал, что
резиновая прокладка в одном месте потеряла эластичность и сквозь нее просачивается вода. Именно
это было причиной падения мощности. Мои спутники весьма внимательно выслушали меня и задали
несколько практических вопросов насчет того, как устранить неисправность. Объяснив им все подробно, я возвратился в главную камеру и из любопытства принялся ее осматривать. С первого же
взгляда было ясно, что история с сукновальной глиной – сплошная выдумка, ибо глупо было даже
предположить, что столь мощный механизм предназначен для столь ничтожной цели. Стены камеры
были деревянные, но основание из железа, и я увидел на нем металлическую накипь. Я наклонился и
попытался соскоблить кусочек, чтобы получше его рассмотреть, как услышал приглушенное восклицание по-немецки и увидел мертвенно-бледное лицо полковника.
– Что вы тут делаете? – спросил он.
Я разозлился, когда понял, как был обманут той искусно придуманной историей, которую он
мне поведал.
– Любуюсь вашей сукновальной глиной, – ответил я. – Думается, я мог бы дать вам лучший совет, если бы знал истинное назначение этого пресса.
Едва я произнес эти слова, как тут же пожалел о своей несдержанности. Лицо его окаменело, в
серых глазах вспыхнул зловещий огонек.
– Ну что ж, – прошипел он, – сейчас вы узнаете все подробности.
Он сделал шаг назад, захлопнул дверцу и повернул ключ в замке. Я бросился к двери, стал дергать за ручку, колотить, но дверь оказалась весьма надежной и никак не поддавалась.
– Эй, полковник! – закричал я. – Выпустите меня.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
I rushed to the door.
И вдруг в тишине раздался звук, от которого душа у меня ушла в пятки. Он включил пресс.
Лампа стояла на полу, где я ее поставил, когда рассматривал накипь, и при свете ее я увидел, что
черный потолок начал двигаться на меня, медленно, толчками, но с такой силой, что через минуту –
и я понимал это лучше, чем кто-либо другой – от меня останется мокрое место. Я снова с криком
бросился к двери, ногтями пытался сорвать замок. Я умолял полковника выпустить меня, но беспощадный лязг рычагов заглушал мои крики. Потолок уже находился на расстоянии одного-двух футов
от меня, и, подняв руку, я мог дотронуться до его твердой и неровной поверхности. И в тот же момент в голове у меня сверкнула мысль о том, что смерть моя может показаться менее болезненной в
зависимости от положения, в каком я ее приму. Если лечь на живот, то вся тяжесть придется на позвоночник, и я содрогнулся, представив себе, как он захрустит. Лучше, конечно, лечь на спину, но
достанет ли у меня духу смотреть, как неумолимо надвигается черная тень? Я уже не мог стоять в
полный рост, но тут я увидел нечто такое, от чего в душе моей затрепетала надежда.
Я уже сказал, что пол и потолок были железными, а стены камеры обшиты деревянной панелью. И вот в ту минуту, когда я в последний раз лихорадочно озирался вокруг, я заметил тонкую
щель желтого света между двумя досками, которая ширилась и ширилась по мере того, как потолок
опускался. На мгновение я даже не поверил, что это выход, который может спасти меня от смерти. В
следующую секунду я бросился вперед и в полуобморочном состоянии свалился с другой стороны.
Отверстие закрылось. Хруст лампы, а затем и стук металлических плит поведали о том, что я был на
волосок от гибели.
Я пришел в себя оттого, что кто-то отчаянно дергал меня за руку, и увидел, что лежу на каменном полу в узком коридоре, надо мной склонилась женщина, одной рукой она тянет меня, а другой –
держит свечу. Это была та самая моя благожелательница, чьим предупреждением я по глупости пренебрег.
– Идемте! Идемте! – задыхаясь, вскричала она. – Они сейчас будут здесь. Они увидят, что вас
там нет. О, не теряйте драгоценного времени, идемте!
На этот раз я внял ее совету. Кое-как поднявшись на ноги, я вместе с ней бросился по коридору,
а потом вниз по винтовой лестнице. Лестница привела нас в более широкий коридор, и тут же мы услышали топот и крики: кто-то, находящийся на том этаже, с которого мы только что спустились, отвечал на возгласы снизу. Моя провожатая остановилась и огляделась вокруг, не зная, что предпринять. Затем она распахнула дверь в спальню, где в окно полным светом светила луна.
– Это единственная возможность, – сказала она. – Окно высоко, но, может, вам удастся спрыгнуть.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
В это время в дальнем конце коридора появился свет, и я увидел полковника Лизандера Старка:
он бежал, держа в одной руке фонарь, а в другой что-то похожее на нож мясника. Я бросился в комнату к окну, распахнул его и выглянул. Каким тихим, приветливыми и спокойным казался сад, залитый лунным светом; окно было не более тридцати футов над землей. Я взобрался на подоконник, но
медлил: мне хотелось узнать, что станется с моей спасительницей. Я решил, несмотря ни на что,
прийти ей на помощь, если ей придется плохо. Едва я подумал об этом, как этот негодяй ворвался в
комнату и бросился ко мне. Она обхватила его обеими руками и пыталась удержать.
– Фриц! Фриц! Вспомни свое обещание после прошлого раза, – кричала она на английском
языке. – Ты обещал, что этого не повторится. Он будет молчать! Он будет молчать!
– Ты сошла с ума, Эльза! – гремел он, стараясь вырваться от нее. – Ты нас погубишь. Он видел
слишком много. Пусти меня, говорю я тебе!
Он отбросил ее в сторону, метнулся к окну и замахнулся своим оружием. Я успел соскользнуть
с подоконника и висел, держась за раму, когда он нанес мне удар. Я почувствовал тупую боль, руки
мои разжались, и я упал в сад под окном.
He cut at me.
Падение меня оглушило, но и только. Я вскочил и со всех ног бросился в кусты, понимая, что
не ушел еще от опасности. На бегу меня вдруг охватила страшная слабость и тошнота. Руку дергало
от боли, и только тогда я заметил, что у меня нет большого пальца и из раны хлещет кровь. Я попытался было обвязать руку носовым платком, но в этот момент в висках у меня застучало, и я свалился
в тяжелом обмороке среди кустов роз.
Сколько я был без сознания, сказать не могу. Наверное, очень долго, потому что, когда я пришел в себя, луна уже зашла и занимался день. Одежда моя промокла до нитки от выпавшей ночью
росы, а рукав пиджака был насквозь пропитан кровью. Жгучая боль напомнила мне о событиях минувшей ночи, и я вскочил на ноги, сознавая, что не могу считать себя в полной безопасности. Но каково же было мое удивление, когда, оглядевшись вокруг, я не увидел ни дома, ни сада. Я лежал у изгороди возле дороги, а немного подальше виднелось длинное строение; когда я подошел к нему, оно
оказалось той самой станцией, куда я и прибыл накануне вечером. И если бы не страшная рана на руке, все происшедшее могло бы показаться просто ночным кошмаром. Ничего не понимая, я вошел в
здание и спросил, скоро ли будет утренний поезд. Менее чем через час будет поезд на Рединг, ответили мне. Дежурил тот самый носильщик, что и накануне. Я спросил у него, не знает ли он полковника Лизандера Старка. Нет, имя это ему незнакомо. Не видел ли он экипаж у станции вчера вечером? Нет, не видел. Есть ли поблизости полицейский участок? Да, милях в трех от станции.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Я совсем ослабел, а рука у меня так болела, что нечего было и думать туда дойти. Я решил сначала вернуться в город, а потом уж пойти в полицию. Я приехал в Лондон в начале седьмого, прежде
всего отправился перевязывать рану, и доктор оказался настолько любезен, что сам привез меня к
вам. Целиком полагаюсь на вас и готов следовать любому вашему совету.
Он закончил свое удивительное повествование, и некоторое время мы сидели молча. Затем
Шерлок Холмс взял с полки один из увесистых альбомов, в которых хранил вырезки из газет.
– Вот заметка, которая может вас заинтересовать, – сказал он. – Она появилась в газетах около
года назад. Послушайте: «9-го числа этого месяца пропал без вести мистер Джереми Хейлинг, двадцати шести лет, по профессии инженер-гидравлик. Он ушел из дома в десять часов вечера, и с тех
пор о нем ничего не известно. Был одет…» и так далее и так далее. Это и был, по-видимому, именно
тот «прошлый раз», когда полковнику понадобилось ремонтировать свой пресс.
– Боже мой! – воскликнул мой пациент. – Так вот что означали слова женщины.
– Несомненно! Совершенно ясно, что полковник – человек хладнокровный и отчаянный и, подобно головорезам, которые не оставляли в живых ни одного человека на захваченном судне, сметает
любые препятствия на своем пути. Однако нельзя терять ни минуты, и если вы в состоянии двигаться, мы немедленно отправимся в Скотланд-Ярд, а потом поедем в Айфорд.
Через каких-нибудь три часа или около того мы все сидели в поезде, направлявшемся из Рединга в маленькую беркширскую деревню. Мы – это Шерлок Холмс, гидротехник, инспектор Бродстрит
из Скотланд-Ярда, агент в штатском и я. Бродстрит расстелил на скамейке подробную карту Англии
и циркулем вычертил на ней окружность с центром в Айфорде.
– Смотрите, эта окружность имеет радиус в десять миль, – сказал он. – Нужное нам место находится где-то внутри этого круга. Вы, кажется, сказали, десять миль, сэр?
– Да, мы ехали около часа.
– И вы предполагаете, что они отвезли вас обратно, пока вы были без сознания?
– По-видимому, так. Мне смутно помнится, что меня поднимали и куда-то несли.
– Не понимаю, – вмешался я, – почему они сохранили вам жизнь, когда нашли вас без сознания
в саду. Может, женщина умолила этого негодяя пощадить вас?
– Вряд ли. За всю мою жизнь не видел более зверской физиономии.
– Все это мы скоро выясним, – сказал Бродстрит. – Итак, окружность готова, сейчас остается
узнать только, в какой точке находятся те люди, которых мы ищем.
– Мне думается, я могу вам показать, – спокойно ответил Холмс.
– Вот как? – воскликнул инспектор. – Значит, у вас уже есть определенное мнение. Посмотрим,
что думают остальные. Я утверждаю, что это произошло на юге, ибо там местность менее населенная.
– А я говорю, на востоке, – возразил мой пациент.
– Я стою за запад, – заметил человек в штатском. – Там расположено несколько тихих деревушек.
– А я – за север, – сказал я. – На севере нет холмов, а наш друг утверждает, что не заметил, чтобы дорога шла в гору.
– Ну и ну! Неплохой букет мнений, – смеясь подытожил инспектор. – Мы назвали все румбы
компаса. Кого же вы поддерживаете, мистер Холмс?
– Вы все ошибаетесь.
– Как же могут все ошибаться?
– Могут. Я считаю, что это произошло здесь. – И Холмс ткнул пальцем в центр окружности. –
Тут мы их и найдем.
– А двенадцатимильная поездка? – удивился Хэдерли.
– Нет ничего проще: шесть миль туда и шесть обратно. Вы сами сказали, что когда вы садились
в экипаж, лошадь была свежей и шерсть у нее лоснилась. Могло ли это быть, если она прошла двенадцать миль по плохой дороге?
– Они в самом деле могли использовать такую уловку, – задумчиво заметил Бродстрит и добавил: – Дела этой шайки, конечно, сомнений не вызывают.
– Разумеется, нет, – ответил Холмс. – Они фальшивомонетчики, причем крупного масштаба,
пресс они используют для чеканки амальгамы, которая заменяет серебро.
– Нам уже некоторое время известно о существовании очень ловкой шайки, которая в огромном
количестве выпускает полукроны, – сказал инспектор. – Мы даже выследили их до Рединга, но потом
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
застряли. Они так умело замели следы, что сразу видно: стреляные воробьи. И все-таки на этот раз
благодаря счастливой случайности их, пожалуй, накроем.
Но инспектор ошибся: преступникам не суждено было попасть в руки правосудия. Подъехав к
Айфорду, мы увидели огромный столб дыма, который гигантским страусовым пером висел над деревьями.
«A house on fire!»
– Пожар? – спросил Бродстрит у начальника станции, когда поезд, пыхтя, двинулся дальше.
– Да, сэр, – ответил тот.
– Когда начался?
– Говорят ночью, сэр, но сейчас усилился, весь дом в огне.
– А чей это дом?
– Доктора Бичерта.
– Скажите, – вмешался Холмс, – доктор Бичер – это тощий немец с длинным острым носом?
Начальник станции громко рассмеялся.
– Нет, сэр, доктор Бичер – самый настоящий англичанин. Но у него в доме живет какой-то
джентльмен, его пациент, говорят, вот он иностранец, и вид у него такой, что ему не помешало бы
отведать нашей доброй беркширской говядины.
Не успел начальник станции договорить, как мы все были уже на пути к горящему дому. Дорога поднималась на невысокий холм, на вершине которого стояло большое приземистое, выбеленное
известкой строение; из окон и дверей его вырывался огонь, а три пожарные машины тщетно пытались прибить пламя.
– Ну конечно же! – воскликнул Хэдерли в крайнем волнении. – Вон дорожка, посыпанная гравием, а вон розовые кусты, где я лежал. А вот это окно, второе с краю, – то самое, из которого я
прыгнул.
– Что ж, – заметил Холмс, – вы по крайней мере сумели им отомстить. Огонь из вашей керосиновой лампы, когда ее сплющило, перекинулся на стены, а преступники, увлекшись погоней, этого
не заметили. Смотрите-ка внимательнее, нет ли в этой толпе ваших вчерашних приятелей, думается
мне, они сейчас уже в доброй сотне миль отсюда.
Предположение Холмса оправдалось, ибо с тех пор мы ни слова не слышали ни о красивой
женщине, ни о злом немце, ни о мрачном англичанине. Правда, утром в тот день один крестьянин
встретил повозку с людьми, доверху набитую какими-то громоздкими ящиками. Повозка направлялась в сторону Рединга, но затем следы беглецов терялись, и даже Холмс при всей его проницательности оказался не в состоянии установить хотя бы приблизительно их местонахождение.
Пожарники были немало озадачены тем странным устройством, которое они обнаружили внут-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ри дома, и еще более тем, что на подоконнике окна на третьем этаже они нашли отрубленный большой палец. На заходе солнца их усилия увенчались наконец успехом, огонь погас, хотя к тому времени крыша уже провалилась и весь дом превратился в руины; от машины, осмотр которой так дорого обошелся нашему незадачливому знакомому, ничего не осталось, если не считать помятых труб и
цилиндров. В сарае обнаружили большие запасы никеля и жести, но ни единой монеты не нашли –
их, по-видимому, увезли в тех громоздких ящиках, о которых уже говорилось.
Мы оба так никогда бы и не узнали, каким образом наш гидравлик очутился на том месте, где
он пришел в себя, если бы не мягкая почва, поведавшая нам весьма простую историю. Его, очевидно,
несли двое, у одного из них были удивительно маленькие ноги, а у второго – необыкновенно большие. В общем, весьма вероятно, что молчаливый англичанин, более трусливый или менее жестокий,
чем его компаньон, помог женщине избавить потерявшего сознание человека от грозившей ему
опасности.
– Да, для меня это хороший урок, – уныло заметил Хэдерли, когда мы сели в поезд, направлявшийся обратно, в Лондон. – Я лишился пальца и пятидесяти гиней, а что я приобрел?
– Опыт, – смеясь, ответил Холмс. – Может, он вам и пригодится. Нужно только облечь его в
слова, чтобы всю жизнь слыть отличным рассказчиком.
Знатный холостяк
The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor
First published in the Strand Magazine, Apr. 1892,
with 8 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
Женитьба лорда Сент-Саймона, закончившаяся таким удивительным образом, давно перестала
занимать те круги великосветского общества, где вращается злополучный жених. Новые скандальные истории своими более пикантными подробностями затмили эту драму и отвлекли от нее внимание салонных болтунов, тем более что с тех пор прошло уже четыре года. Но так как я имею основание думать, что многие факты так и не дошли до широкой публики, и так как это дело прояснилось
главным образом благодаря моему другу Шерлоку Холмсу, я считаю, что мои воспоминания о нем
были бы неполны без краткого очерка об этом любопытном эпизоде.
Как-то днем, за несколько недель до моей собственной свадьбы, когда я еще жил вместе с Холмсом на Бейкер-стрит, на его имя пришло письмо. Холмса не было дома, он где-то бродил после обеда, я же весь день сидел в комнате, потому что погода внезапно испортилась, поднялся сильный
осенний ветер, пошел дождь, и застрявшая в ноге пуля, которую я привез с собой на память об афганском походе, напоминала о себе тупой непрерывной болью. Удобно усевшись в одном кресле и
положив ноги на другое, я занялся чтением газет, но потом, пресыщенный злободневными новостями, отшвырнул весь этот бумажный ворох в сторону и от нечего делать стал разглядывать лежавшее
на столе письмо. Огромный герб и монограмма красовались на конверте, и я лениво размышлял о
том, какая же это важная особа состоит в переписке с моим другом.
– Вас ждет великосветское послание, – сообщил я Холмсу, когда он вошел в комнату. – А с утренней почтой вы, если не ошибаюсь, получили письма от торговца рыбой и таможенного чиновника?
– Вся прелесть моей корреспонденции именно в ее разнообразии, – ответил он улыбаясь, – и в
большинстве случаев, чем скромнее автор письма, тем интереснее письмо. А вот это, мне кажется,
одно из тех несносных официальных приглашений, которые либо нагоняют на вас скуку, либо заставляют прибегнуть ко лжи.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
He broak the seal and glanced over the contents.
Он сломал печать и быстро пробежал письмо.
– Э, нет! Тут, пожалуй, может оказаться кое-что интересное.
– Значит, это не приглашение?
– Нет, письмо сугубо деловое.
– И от знатного клиента?
– От одного из самых знатных в Англии.
– Поздравляю вас, милый друг.
– Даю вам слово, Уотсон, – и поверьте, я не рисуюсь, – что общественное положение моего
клиента значит для меня гораздо меньше, чем его дело. Однако этот случай может оказаться любопытным. Вы, кажется, довольно усердно читали газеты в последнее время?
– Как видите! – ответил я уныло, показывая на груду газет в углу. – Больше мне ничего было
делать.
– Это очень кстати. В таком случае вы сможете информировать меня. Я ведь ничего не читаю,
кроме уголовной хроники и объявлений о розыске пропавших родственников. Там бывают поучительные вещи. Ну, а если вы следили за происшествиями, то, вероятно, читали о лорде Сент-Саймоне
и его свадьбе?
– О да! С большим интересом.
– Отлично. Так вот, в руке у меня письмо от лорда Сент-Саймона. Сейчас я прочитаю его вам, а
вы за это время еще раз просмотрите газеты и расскажете все, что имеет отношение к этой истории.
Вот что он пишет:
«Уважаемый мистер Шерлок Холмс!
Лорд Бэкуотер сказал мне, что я вполне могу довериться Вашему чутью и Вашему
умению хранить тайну. Поэтому я решил обратиться к Вам за советом по поводу прискорбного события, которое произошло в связи с моей свадьбой. Мистер Лестрейд из
Скотланд-Ярда уже ведет расследование по этому делу, но он ничего не имеет против
Вашего сотрудничества, и даже считает, что оно может оказаться полезным. Я буду у Вас
сегодня в четыре часа дня и надеюсь, что ввиду первостепенной важности моего дела Вы
отложите все другие встречи, если они назначены Вами на это время.
Уважающий вас Роберт Сент-Саймон».
– Письмо отправлено из особняка в Гровнере и написано гусиным пером, причем благородный
лорд имел несчастье испачкать чернилами тыльную сторону правого мизинца, – сказал Холмс, складывая послание.
– Он пишет, что приедет в четыре часа. Сейчас три. Через час он будет здесь.
– Значит, я как раз успею с вашей помощью выяснить кое-какие обстоятельства. Просмотрите
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
газеты и подберите заметки в хронологическом порядке, а я, покамест, взгляну, что представляет собой наш клиент.
Он взял с полки толстую книгу в красном переплете, стоявшую в ряду с другими справочниками.
– Вот он! – сказал Холмс, усевшись в кресло и раскрыв книгу у себя на коленях. – «Роберт Уолсингэм де Вир Сент-Саймон, второй сын герцога Балморалского». Гм!.. «Герб: голубое поле, три
звездочки чертополоха над полоской собольего меха. Родился в 1846». Значит, ему сорок один год –
достаточно зрелый возраст для женитьбы. Был товарищем министра колоний в прежнем составе Кабинета. Герцог, его отец, был одно время министром иностранных дел. Потомки Плантагенетов по
мужской линии и Тюдоров – по женской. Так… Все это ничего нам не дает. Надеюсь, что вы, Уотсон, приготовили что-нибудь более существенное?
– Мне было совсем нетрудно найти нужный материал, – сказал я. – Ведь события эти произошли совсем недавно и сразу привлекли мое внимание. Я только потому не рассказывал вам о них, что
вы были заняты каким-то расследованием, а мне известно, как вы не любите, когда вас отвлекают.
– А, вы имеете в виду ту пустячную историю с фургоном для перевозки мебели по Гровнерсквер? Она уже совершенно выяснена, да, впрочем, там все было ясно с самого начала. Ну, расскажите же, что вы там откопали.
– Вот первая заметка. Она помещена несколько недель назад в «Морнинг пост», в разделе
«Хроника светской жизни»: «Состоялась помолвка, и, если верить слухам, в скором времени состоится бракосочетание лорда Роберта Сент-Саймона, второго сына герцога Балморалского, и мисс Хетти Доран, единственной дочери эсквайра Алоизиеса Дорана, из Сан-Франциско, Калифорния, США».
– Коротко и ясно, – заметил Холмс, протягивая поближе к огню свои длинные, тонкие ноги.
– На той же самой неделе в какой-то газете, в светской хронике, был столбец, в котором более
подробно говорилось об этой происшествии. Ага, вот он:
«В скором времени понадобится издание закона об охране нашего брачного рынка,
ибо принцип свободной торговли, господствующий ныне, весьма вредно отражается на
нашей отечественной продукции. Власть над отпрысками благороднейших фамилий Великобритании постепенно переходит в ручки наших прелестных заатлантических кузин.
Список трофеев, захваченных очаровательными завоевательницами, пополнился на прошлой неделе весьма ценным приобретением. Лорд Сент-Саймон, который в течение двадцати с лишним лет был неуязвим для стрел Амура, недавно объявил о своем намерении
вступить в брак с мисс Хетти Доран, пленительной дочерью калифорнийского миллионера. Мисс Доран, чья грациозная фигура и прелестное лицо произвели фурор на всех
празднествах в Вестбери-Хаус, является единственной дочерью, и, по слухам, ее приданое приближается к миллиону, не говоря уже о видах на будущее. Так как ни для кого не
секрет, что герцог Балморалский был вынужден за последние годы распродать свою коллекцию картин, а у лорда Сент-Саймона нет собственного состояния, если не считать небольшого поместья в Берчмуре, ясно, что от этого союза, который с легкостью превратит
гражданку республики в титулованную английскую леди, выиграет не только калифорнийская наследница».
– Что-нибудь еще? – спросил Холмс, зевая. – О да, и очень много. Вот другая заметка. В ней говорится, что свадьба будет самая скромная, что венчание состоится в церкви святого Георгия, на Гановер-сквер, и приглашены будут только пять-шесть самых близких друзей, а потом все общество
отправится в меблированный особняк на Ланкастер-гейт, нанятый мистером Алоизиесом Дораном.
Два дня спустя, то есть в прошлую среду, появилось краткое сообщение о том, что венчание состоялось и что медовый месяц молодые проведут в поместье лорда Бэкуотера, близ Питерсфилда. Вот и
все, что было в газетах до исчезновения невесты.
– Как вы сказали? – спросил Холмс, вскакивая с места.
– До исчезновения новобрачной, – повторил я.
– Когда же она исчезла?
– Во время свадебного обеда.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Вот как! Дело становится куда интереснее. Весьма драматично.
– Да, мне тоже показалось, что тут что-то не совсем заурядное.
– Женщины нередко исчезают до брачной церемонии, порою во время медового месяца, но я не
могу припомнить ни одного случая, когда бы исчезновение произошло столь скоропалительно. Расскажите мне, пожалуйста, подробности.
– Предупреждаю, что они далеко не полны.
– Ну, может быть, нам самим удастся их пополнить.
– Вчера появилась статья в утренней газете, и это все. Сейчас я прочту вам ее. Заголовок: «Удивительное происшествие на великосветской свадьбе».
«Семья лорда Роберта Сент-Саймона потрясена загадочными и в высшей степени
прискорбными событиями, связанными с его женитьбой. Венчание действительно состоялось вчера утром, как об этом коротко сообщалось во вчерашних газетах, но только
сегодня мы можем подтвердить странные слухи, упорно циркулирующие в публике. Несмотря на попытки друзей замять происшествие, оно привлекло к себе всеобщее внимание, и теперь уже нет смысла замалчивать то, что сделалось достоянием толпы.
Свадьба была очень скромная и происходила в церкви святого Георгия. Присутствовали только отец невесты – мистер Алоизиес Доран, герцогиня Балморалская, лорд Бэкуотер, лорд Юсташ и леди Клара Сент-Саймон (младшие брат и сестра жениха), а также
леди Алисия Уитингтон. После венчания все общество отправилось на Ланкастер-гейт,
где в доме мистера Алоизиеса Дорана их ждал обед. По слухам, там имел место небольшой инцидент: неизвестная женщина – ее имя так и не было установлено – пыталась проникнуть в дом вслед за гостями, утверждая, будто у нее есть какие-то права на лорда
Сент-Саймона. И только после продолжительной и тяжелой сцены дворецкому и лакею
удалось выпроводить эту особу. Невеста, к счастью, вошла в дом до этого неприятного
вторжения. Она села за стол вместе с остальными, но вскоре пожаловалась на внезапное
недомогание и ушла в свою комнату. Так как она долго не возвращалась, гости начали
выражать недоумение. Мистер Алоизиес Доран отправился за дочерью, но ее горничная
сообщила, что мисс Хетти заходила в комнату только на минутку, что она накинула
длинное дорожное пальто, надела шляпу и быстро пошла к выходу. Один из лакеев подтвердил, что какая-то дама в пальто и в шляпке действительно вышла из дому, но он никак не мог признать в ней свою госпожу, так как был уверен, что та в это время сидит за
столом с гостями. Убедившись, что дочь исчезла, мистер Алоизиес Доран немедленно
отправился с новобрачным в полицию, и начались энергичные поиски, которые, вероятно, очень скоро прольют свет на это удивительное происшествие. Однако пока что местопребывание исчезнувшей леди не выяснено. Ходят слухи, что тут имеет место шантаж
и что женщина, которая разыскивала лорда Сент-Саймона, арестована, ибо полиция
предполагает, что из ревности или из иных побуждений она могла быть причастна к таинственному исчезновению новобрачной».
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
She was ejected by the butler and the footman.
– И это все?
– Есть еще одна заметка в другой утренней газете. Пожалуй, она даст вам кое-что.
– О чем же она?
– О том, что мисс Флора Миллар, виновница скандала, и в самом деле арестована. Кажется, она
была прежде танцовщицей в «Аллегро» и встречалась с лордом Сент– Саймоном в течение нескольких лет. Других подробностей нет, так что теперь вам известно все, что напечатано об этом случае в
газетах.
– Дело представляется мне чрезвычайно интересным. Я был бы крайне огорчен, если бы оно
прошло мимо меня. Но кто-то звонит, Уотсон. Пятый час. Не сомневаюсь, что это идет наш высокородный клиент. Только не вздумайте уходить: мне может понадобиться свидетель, хотя бы на тот
случай, если я что-нибудь забуду.
– Лорд Роберт Сент-Саймон! – объявил наш юный слуга, распахивая дверь.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Lord Robert St. Simon.
Вошел джентльмен с приятными тонкими чертами лица, бледный, с крупным носом, с чуть
надменным ртом и твердым, открытым взглядом – взглядом человека, которому выпал счастливый
жребий повелевать и встречать повиновение. Движения у него были легкие и живые, но из-за некоторой сутулости и манеры сгибать колени при ходьбе он казался старше своих лет. Волосы на висках
у него поседели, а когда он снял шляпу с загнутыми полями, обнаружилось, что они, кроме того,
сильно поредели на макушке. Его костюм представлял верх изящества, граничившего с фатовством:
высокий крахмальный воротничок, черный сюртук с белым жилетом, желтые перчатки, лакированные ботинки и светлые гетры. Он медленно вошел в комнату и огляделся по сторонам, нервно вертя
в руке шнурок от золотого лорнета.
– Добрый день, лорд Сент-Саймон, – любезно сказал Холмс, поднимаясь навстречу посетителю. – Садитесь, пожалуйста, сюда, в плетеное кресло. Это мой друг и коллега, доктор Уотсон. Придвиньтесь поближе к огню, и потолкуем о вашем деле…
–… как нельзя более мучительном для меня, мистер Холмс! Я потрясен. Разумеется, вам не раз
приходилось вести дела щекотливого свойства, сэр, но вряд ли ваши клиенты принадлежали к такому
классу общества, к которому принадлежу я.
– Да, вы правы, это для меня ступень вниз.
– Простите?
– Последним моим клиентом по делу такого рода был король.
– Вот как! Я не знал. Какой же это король?
– Король Скандинавии.
– Как, у него тоже пропала жена?
– Надеюсь, вы понимаете, – самым учтивым тоном произнес Холмс, – что в отношении всех
моих клиентов я соблюдаю такую же тайну, какую обещаю и вам.
– О, конечно, конечно! Вы совершенно правы, прошу меня извинить. Что касается моего случая, я готов сообщить вам любые сведения, какие могут помочь вам составить мнение по поводу
происшедшего.
– Благодарю вас. Я уже ознакомился с тем, что было в газетах, но не знаю ничего больше. Надо
полагать, что можно считать их сообщения верными? Хотя бы вот эту заметку – об исчезновении невесты?
Лорд Сент-Саймон наскоро пробежал заметку.
– Да, это более или менее верно.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Но для того, чтобы я мог прийти к определеному заключению, мне понадобится ряд дополнительных данных. Пожалуй, лучше будет, если я задам вам несколько вопросов.
– Я к вашим услугам.
– Когда вы познакомились с мисс Хетти Доран?
– Год назад, в Сан-Франциско.
– Вы путешествовали по Соединенным Штатам?
– Да.
– Вы еще там обручились с нею?
– Нет.
– Но вы ухаживали за ней?
– Мне было приятно ее общество, и я этого не скрывал.
– Отец ее очень богат?
– Он считается самым богатым человеком на всем Тихоокеанском побережье.
– А где и как он разбогател?
– На золотых приисках. Еще несколько лет назад у него ничего не было. Потом ему посчастливилось напасть на богатую золотоносную жилу, он удачно поместил капитал и быстро пошел в гору.
– А не могли бы вы обрисовать мне характер молодой леди – вашей супруги? Что она за человек?
Лорд Сент-Саймон начал быстро раскачивать лорнет и посмотрел в огонь.
– Видите ли, мистер Холмс, – сказал он, – моей жене было уже двадцать лет, когда ее отец стал
богатым человеком. До того она свободно носилась по прииску и бродила по лесам и горам, так что
ее воспитанием занималась скорее природа, чем школа. Настоящая «сорви-голова», как мы называем
таких девушек в Англии, натура сильная и свободолюбивая, не скованная никакими традициями. У
нее порывистый, я бы даже сказал, бурный характер. Быстро принимает решения и бесстрашно доводит до конца то, что задумала. С другой стороны, я не дал бы ей имени, которое имею честь носить, –
тут он с достоинством откашлялся, – если бы не был уверен, что, в сущности, это благороднейшее
создание. Я твердо знаю, что она способна на героическое самопожертвование и что все бесчестное
ее отталкивает.
– Есть у вас ее фотография?
– Я принес с собой вот это.
Он открыл медальон и показал нам прелестное женское лицо. Это была не фотография, а миниатюра на слоновой кости. Художнику удалось передать прелесть блестящих черных волос, больших темных глаз, изящно очерченного рта. Холмс долго и внимательно рассматривал миниатюру,
потом закрыл медальон и вернул его лорду Сент-Саймону.
– А потом молодая девушка приехала в Лондон и вы возобновили знакомство с нею?
– Да, на этот сезон отец привез ее в Лондон, мы начали встречаться, обручились, и вот теперь я
женился на ней.
– За ней дали, должно быть, порядочное приданое?
– Прекрасное приданое, но такова традиция в нашей семье.
– И поскольку ваш брак – уже совершившийся факт, оно конечно, останется в вашем распоряжении?
– Право, не знаю. Я не наводил никаких справок на этот счет.
– Ну, понятно. Скажите, виделись вы с мисс Доран накануне свадьбы?
– Да.
– И в каком она была настроении?
– В отличном. Все время строила планы нашей будущей совместной жизни.
– Вот как? Это чрезвычайно любопытно. А утром в день свадьбы?
– Она была очень весела – по крайней мере до конца церемонии.
– А потом вы, стало быть, заметили в ней какую-то перемену?
– Да, по правде говоря, я тогда впервые имел случай убедиться в некоторой неровности ее характера. Впрочем, этот эпизод настолько незначителен, что не стоит о нем и рассказывать. Он не
имеет ни малейшего значения.
– Все-таки расскажите, прошу вас.
– Хорошо, но это такое ребячество… Когда мы с ней шли от алтаря, она уронила букет. В этот
момент мы как раз поравнялись с передней скамьей, и букет упал под скамью. Произошло минутное
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
замешательство, но какой-то джентльмен, сидевший на скамье, тут же нагнулся и подал ей букет, который ничуть не пострадал. И все-таки, когда я заговорил с ней об этом, она ответила какой-то резкостью и потом, сидя в карете, когда мы ехали домой, казалась до нелепости взволнованной этой
ерундой.
The gentleman in the pew handed it up to her.
– Ах вот что! Значит, на скамье сидел какой-то джентльмен? Стало быть, в церкви все-таки была посторонняя публика?
– Ну конечно. Это неизбежно, раз церковь открыта.
– И этот джентльмен не принадлежал к числу знакомых вашей жены?
– О нет! Я только из вежливости назвал его «джентльменом»: судя по виду, это человек не нашего круга. Впрочем, я даже не разглядел его хорошенько. Но, право же, мы отвлекаемся от темы.
– Итак, возвратясь из церкви, леди Сент-Саймон была уже не в таком хорошем расположении
духа? Чем она занялась, когда вошла в дом отца?
– Начала что-то рассказывать своей горничной.
– А что представляет собой ее горничная?
– Ее зовут Алиса. Она американка и приехала вместе со своей госпожой из Калифорнии.
– Вероятно она пользуется доверием вашей жены?
– Пожалуй, даже чересчур большим доверием. Мне всегда казалось, что мисс Хетти слишком
много ей позволяет. Впрочем, в Америке иначе смотрят на эти вещи.
– Сколько времени продолжался их разговор?
– Кажется, несколько минут. Не знаю, право, я был слишком занят.
– И вы не слышали о чем они говорили?
– Леди Сент-Саймон сказала что-то о «захвате чужого участка». Она постоянно употребляет такого рода жаргонные словечки. Понятия не имею, что она имела в виду.
– Американский жаргон иногда очень выразителен. А что делала ваша жена после разговора со
служанкой?
– Пошла в столовую.
– Под руку с вами?
– Нет, одна. Она чрезвычайно независима в таких мелочах. Минут через десять она поспешно
встала из-за стола, пробормотала какие-то извинения и вышла из комнаты. Больше я не видел ее.
– Если не ошибаюсь, горничная Алиса показала на допросе, что ее госпожа вошла в свою комнату, накинула на подвенечное платье длинное дорожное пальто, надела шляпку и ушла.
– Совершенно верно. И потом ее видели в Гайд-парке. Она там была с Флорой Миллар – женщиной, которая утром того же дня устроила скандал в доме мистера Дорана. Сейчас она арестована.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Ах да, расскажите, пожалуйста, об этой молодой особе и о характере ваших отношений.
Лорд Сент-Саймон пожал плечами и поднял брови.
– В течение нескольких лет мы были с ней в дружеских, я бы даже сказал, в очень дружеских
отношениях. Она танцевала в «Аллегро». Я обошелся с ней, как подобает благородному человеку, и
она не может иметь ко мне никаких претензий, но вы же знаете женщин, мистер Холмс, Флора – очаровательное существо, но она чересчур импульсивна я до безумия влюблена в меня. Узнав, что я собираюсь жениться, она начала писать мне ужасные письма, и, говоря откровенно, я только потому и
устроил такую скромную свадьбу, что боялся скандала в церкви. Едва мы успели приехать после
венчания, как она прибежала к дому мистера Дорана и сделала попытку проникнуть туда, выкрикивая при этом оскорбления и даже угрозы по адресу моей жены. Однако, предвидя возможность чеголибо в этом роде, я заранее пригласил двух полицейских в штатском, и те быстро выпроводили ее.
Как только Флора поняла, что скандалом тут не поможешь, она сразу успокоилась.
– Слышала все это ваша жена?
– К счастью, нет.
– А потом с этой самой женщиной ее видели на улице?
– Да. И вот этот-то факт мистер Лестрейд из Скотланд-Ярда считает тревожным. Он думает,
что Флора выманила мою жену из дому и устроила ей какую-нибудь ужасную ловушку.
– Что ж, это не лишено вероятия.
– Значит, и вы того же мнения?
– Вот этого я не сказал. Ну, а сами вы допускаете такую возможность?
– Я убежден, что Флора не способна обидеть и муху.
– Однако ревность иногда совершенно меняет характер человека. Скажите, а каким образом
объясняете то, что произошло, вы сами?
– Я пришел сюда не для того, чтобы объяснять что-либо, а чтобы получить объяснение от вас.
Я сообщил вам все факты, какими располагал. Впрочем, если вас интересует моя точка зрения, извольте: я допускаю, что возбуждение, которое испытала моя жена в связи с огромной переменой,
происшедшей в ее судьбе, в ее общественном положении, могло вызвать у нее легкое нервное расстройство.
– Короче говоря, вы полагаете, что она внезапно потеряла рассудок?
– Если хотите, да. Когда я думаю, что она могла отказаться… не от меня, нет, но от всего того,
о чем тщетно мечтали многие другие женщины, мне трудно найти иное объяснение.
– Что же, и это тоже вполне приемлемая гипотеза, – ответил Холмс улыбаясь. – Теперь, лорд
Сент-Саймон, у меня, пожалуй, есть почти все нужные сведения. Скажите только одно: могли вы,
сидя за свадебном столом, видеть в окно то, что происходило на улице?
– Нам виден был противоположный тротуар и парк.
– Отлично. Итак, у меня, пожалуй, больше нет необходимости вас задерживать. Я напишу вам.
– Только бы вам посчастливилось разрешить эту загадку! – сказал наш клиент, поднимаясь с
места.
– Я уже разрешил ее.
– Что? Я, кажется, ослышался.
– Я сказал, что разрешил эту загадку.
– В таком случае, где же моя жена?
– Очень скоро я отвечу вам и на этот вопрос.
Лорд Сент-Саймон нахмурился.
– Боюсь, что над этим делом еще немало помучаются и более мудрые головы, чем у нас с вами, – заметил он и, церемонно поклонившись, с достоинством удалился.
Шерлок Холмс засмеялся:
– Лорд Сент-Саймон оказал моей голове большую честь, поставив ее на один уровень со своей!.. Знаете что, я не прочь бы выпить виски с содовой и выкурить сигару после этого длительного
допроса. А заключение по данному делу сложилось у меня еще до того, как наш клиент вошел в комнату.
– Полноте, Холмс!
– В моих заметках есть несколько аналогичных случаев, хотя, как я уже говорил вам, ни одно из
тех исчезновений не было столь скоропалительным. Беседа же с лордом Сент-Саймоном превратила
мои предположения в уверенность. Побочные обстоятельства бывают иногда так же красноречивы,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
как муха в молоке, – если вспомнить Торо.
23
– Однако, Холмс, ведь я присутствовал при разговоре и слышал то же, что слышали и вы.
– Да, но вы не знаете тех случаев, которые уже имели место и которые сослужили мне отличную службу. Почти такая же история произошла несколько лет назад в Абердине и нечто очень похожее – в Мюнжене, на следующий год после франко-прусской войны. Данный случай… А, вот и
Лестрейд! Здравствуйте, Лестрейд! Вон там, на буфете, вино, а здесь, в ящике, сигары.
Официальный сыщик Скотланд-Ярда был облачен в куртку и носил на шее шарф, что делало
его похожим на моряка. В руке он держал черный парусиновый саквояж. Отрывисто поздоровавшись, он опустился на стул и закурил предложенную сигару.
– Ну, выкладывайте, что случилось? – спросил Холмс с лукавым огоньком в глазах. – У вас недовольный вид.
– И я действительно недоволен. Черт бы побрал этого Сент-Саймона с его свадьбой! Ничего не
могу понять.
– Неужели? Вы удивляете меня.
– В жизни не встречал более запутанной истории. Не найти никаких концов. Сегодня я провозился с ней весь день.
– И, кажется, при этом изрядно промокли, – сказал Холмс, дотрагиваясь до рукава куртки.
– Да, я обшаривал дно Серпентайна.
24
– О, Господи! Да зачем вам это понадобилось?
– Чтобы найти тело леди Сент-Саймон.
«There,» said he.
Шерлок Холмс откинулся на спинку кресла и от души расхохотался.
– А бассейн фонтана на Трафальгард-сквер вы не забыли обшарить? – спросил он.
– На Трафальгард-сквер? Что вы хотите этим сказать?
– Да то, что у вас точно такие же шансы найти леди Сент-Саймон здесь, как и там.
Лестрейд бросил сердитый взгляд на моего друга.
– Как видно, вы уже разобрались в этом деле? – насмешливо спросил он.
– Мне только что рассказали о нем, но я уже пришел к определенному выводу.
– Неужели! Так вы считаете, что Серпентайн тут ни при чем?
– Полагаю, что так.
– В таком случае, прошу объяснить, каким образом мы могли найти в пруду вот это.
Он открыл саквояж и выбросил на пол шелковое подвенечное платье, пару белых атласных туфелек и веночек с вуалью – все грязное и совершенно мокрое.
– Извольте! – сказал Лестрейд, кладя на эту кучу новенькое обручальное кольцо. – Раскусите-ка

24 24Серпентайн (Змейка) – пруд в Гайд-парке, в Лондоне.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
этот орешек, мистер Холмс!
– Вот оно что! – сказал Холмс, выпуская сизые кольца дыма. – И все эти вещи вы выудили в
пруду?
– Они плавали у самого берега, их нашел сторож парка. Родственники леди Сент– Саймон опознали и платье и все остальное. По-моему, если там была одежда, то где– нибудь поблизости найдется и тело.
– Если исходить из этой остроумной теории, тело каждого человека должно быть найдено рядом с его одеждой. Так чего же вы надеетесь добиться с помощью вещей леди Сент-Саймон, хотел
бы я знать?
– Какой-нибудь улики, доказывающей, что в ее исчезновении замешана Флора Миллар.
– Боюсь, это будет нелегко.
– Боитесь? – с горечью вскричал Лестрейд. – А я, Холмс, боюсь, что вы совсем оторвались от
жизни с вашими вечными теориями и умозаключениями. За несколько минут вы сделали две грубые
ошибки, Вот это самое платье, несомненно, уличает мисс Флору Миллар.
– Каким же образом?
– В платье есть карман. В кармане нашелся футляр для визитных карточек. А в футляре – записка. Вот она. – Он расправил записку на столе. – Сейчас я прочту ее вам: «Увидимся, когда все будет готово. Выходите немедленно. Ф. X. М.». Я с самого начала предполагал, что Флора Миллар под
каким-нибудь предлогом выманила леди Сент-Саймон из дому и, разумеется, вместе с сообщниками
является виновницей ее исчезновения. И вот перед нами записка – записка с ее инициалами, которую
она, несомненно сунула леди Сент-Саймон у дверей дома, чтобы завлечь ее в свои сети.
– Отлично, Лестрейд, – со смехом сказал Холмс. – Право же, вы очень ловко все это придумали. Покажите-ка записку.
Он небрежно взял в руку бумажку, но что-то в ней вдруг приковало его внимание.
– Да, это действительно очень важно! – сказал он с довольным видом.
– Ага! Теперь убедились?
– Чрезвычайно важно! Сердечно поздравляю вас, Лестрейд.
Торжествующий Лестрейд вскочил и наклонился над запиской.
– Что это? – изумился он. – Ведь вы смотрите не на ту сторону?
– Нет, я смотрю именно туда, куда нужно.
– Да вы с ума сошли! Переверните бумажку. Записка-то ведь написана карандашом на обороте!
– Зато здесь я вижу обрывок счета гостиницы, который весьма интересует меня.
– Ничего в нем нет особенного! Я уже видел его: «Окт. 4-го. Комната – 8 шил. Завтрак – 2
шил.6 пенс. Коктейль – 1 шил. Ленч – 2 шил. 6 пенс. Стакан хереса – 8 пенс». Вот и все. Не вижу ничего интересного.
– Вполне возможно, что не видите. А между тем этот счет имеет большое значение. Что касается записки, она тоже имеет значение, во всяком случае, ее инициалы. Так что поздравляю вас еще
раз, Лестрейд.
– Ну, хватит терять время! – сказал тот, поднимаясь с места. – Я, знаете ли, считаю, что надо
работать, а не сидеть у камина и разводить разные там теории. До свидания, мистер Холмс. Посмотрим, кто первым доберется до сути этого дела.
Он собрал принесенную одежду, сунул ее в саквояж и направился к двери.
– Два слова, Лестрейд, – медленно произнес Холмс, обращаясь к спине своего уходящего соперника. – Я могу вам открыть разгадку вашего дела. Леди Сент-Саймон – миф. Ее нет и никогда не
было.
Лестрейд обернулся и с грустью взглянул на моего друга. Потом он посмотрел на меня, трижды
постучал пальцем по лбу, многозначительно покачал головой и поспешно вышел.
Как только за ним закрылась дверь, Холмс встал и надел пальто.
– В том, что сказал этот субъект, есть доля истины, – заметил он. – Нельзя все время сидеть дома, надо работать. Поэтому, Уотсон, я должен ненадолго оставить вас наедине с вашими газетами.
Шерлок Холмс покинул меня в половине шестого, но я недолго оставался в одиночестве, ибо не
прошло и часа, как к нам явился посыльный из гастрономического магазина с большущей коробкой.
С помощью мальчика, пришедшего с ним вместе, он распаковал ее, и, к моему великому удивлению,
на скромном обеденном столе нашей квартирки появился роскошный холодный ужин. Здесь была
парочка холодных вальдшнепов, фазан, паштет из гусиной печенки и несколько пыльных, покрытых
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
паутиной бутылок старого вина. Расставив все эти лакомые блюда, оба посетителя исчезли, подобно
духами из «Тысячи и одной ночи», успев сказать только, что за все уплачено и велено доставить по
этому адресу.
Около девяти в комнату бодрыми шагами вошел Холмс. Лицо его было серьезно, но в глазах
блестел огонек, по которому я сразу угадал, что он не обманулся в своих догадках.
– А, ужин уже на столе! – сказал он, потирая руки.
– Вы, значит, ждете гостей? Они накрыли на пять персон.
– Да, я думаю, что к нам может кое-кто зайти, – ответил он. – Странно, что лорда Сент-Саймона
еще нет… Ага! Кажется, я слышу на лестнице его шаги.
Он не ошибся. В комнату быстро вошел наш утренний посетитель, еще сильнее прежнего раскачивая висевший на шнурке лорнет. На его аристократическом лице отражалось сильнейшее смятение.
– Стало быть, мой посыльный застал вас дома? – спросил Холмс.
– Да, но признаюсь, содержание письма поразило меня сверх всякой меры. Есть ли у вас доказательства того, что вы сообщили?
– Есть, и самые веские.
Лорд Сент-Саймон опустился в кресло и провел рукой по лбу.
– Что скажет герцог! – прошептал он. – Что он скажет, когда услышит об унижении, которому
подвергся один из членов его семьи!
– Но ведь тут чистейшая случайность. Я никак не могу согласиться, что в этом есть что-нибудь
унизительное.
– Ах, вы смотрите на такие вещи с другой точки зрения!
– Я решительно не вижу здесь ничьей вины. Мне кажется, эта леди просто не могла поступить
иначе. Конечно. она действовала чересчур стремительно, но ведь у нее нет матери – ей не с кем было
посоветоваться в критическую минуту.
– Это оскорбление, сэр, публичное оскорбление! – сказал лорд Сент-Саймон, барабаня пальцами по столу.
– Однако вы должны принять в расчет то исключительно положение, в котором оказалась бедная молодая девушка.
– Я не собираюсь принимать в расчет что бы то ни было. Со мной поступили бесчестно. Я просто вне себя.
– Кажется, звонят, – заметил Холмс. – Да, я слышу шаги на площадке… Что ж, если я не в силах убедить, вас, лорд Сент-Саймон, более снисходительно отнестись ко всему случившемуся, то,
может быть, это скорее удастся адвокату, которого я пригласил.
Холмс распахнул дверь и впустил в комнату даму и господина.
– Лорд Сент-Саймон, – сказал он, – позвольте представить вас мистеру и миссис Фрэнсис Хей
Маултон. С миссис Маултон вы, кажется, уже знакомы.
При виде новых посетителей наш клиент вскочил с места. Он стоял выпрямившись, опустив
глаза, заложив руку за борт сюртука, – воплощение оскорбленного достоинства. Дама подбежала к
нему и протянула руку, но он упорно не поднимал глаз. Так было, пожалуй, лучше для него, если он
хотел остаться непреклонным: вряд ли кто-нибудь мог бы устоять перед ее умоляющим взглядом.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
A picture of offended dignity.
– Вы сердитесь, Роберт? – сказала она. – Что ж, я понимаю, вы не можете не сердиться.
– Сделайте одолжение, не оправдывайтесь, – с горечью произнес лорд Сент-Саймон.
– Да, да, я знаю, я виновата, мне надо было поговорить с вами перед тем, как уйти, но я словно
обезумела и с той самой минуты, как вдруг увидела Фрэнка, уже не сознавала, что делаю и что говорю. Удивительно еще, как это я не упала в обморок перед алтарем!
– Быть может, сударыня, вам угодно, чтобы мы – я и мой друг удалились на то время, пока вы
будете объясняться с лордом Сент-Саймоном? – спросил Холмс.
– Если мне будет позволено выказать мое мнение, – вмешался мистер Маултон, – я скажу, что
хватит делать тайну из этой истории. Что до меня, так я бы хотел, чтобы вся Европа и вся Америка
услышали наконец правду.
Маултон был крепкий, загорелый молодой человек небольшого роста, с резкими чертами лица
и быстрыми движениями.
– Ну хорошо, тогда я расскажу, как было дело, – сказала его спутница. – Мы с Фрэнком познакомились в 1881 году на прииске Мак-Квайра, близ Скалистых гор, где папа разрабатывал участок.
Мы дали друг другу слово. Но вот однажды папа напал на богатую золотоносную жилу и разбогател,
а участок бедного Фрэнка все истощался и в конце концов совсем перестал что-либо давать. Чем богаче становился папа, тем беднее становился Фрэнк. Папа теперь и слышать не хотел о нашем обручении и увез меня во Фриско. Но Фрэнк не сдавался. Он поехал за мной во Фриско, и мы продолжали
видеться без ведома папы. Папа страшно рассердился бы, если б узнал об этом, поэтому мы и решили
все сами. Фрэнк сказал, что он уедет и тоже наживет состояние и что приедет за мной только тогда,
когда у него будет столько же денег, сколько у папы. А я пообещала, что буду ждать его, сколько бы
ни понадобилось, и не выйду замуж за другого, пока он жив. «Если так, – сказал мне Фрэнк, – почему
бы нам не обвенчаться теперь же? Я буду уверен в тебе, а твоим мужем стану лишь тогда, когда вернусь». Так мы и решили. Он отлично все устроил, священник обвенчал нас, и Фрэнк уехал искать
счастья, а я вернулась к папе.
Через некоторое время я узнала, что Френк в Монтане. Потом он уехал искать золото в Аризону, а следующее известие о нем я получила уже из Нью-Мексико. Потом появилась длинная газетная
статья о нападении на прииски индейцев-апачей, и в списке убитых было имя моего Фрэнка. Я потеряла сознание и потом несколько месяцев была тяжело больна. Папа уже думал, что у меня чахотка,
и водил меня по всем докторам Фриско. Больше года я ни слова не слыхала о Фрэнке и была совершенно уверена, что он умер. Тут во Фриско приехал лорд Сент-Саймон, потом мы с папой поехали в
Лондон, была решена свадьба, и папа был очень доволен, но я все время чувствовала, что ни один
мужчина в мире не может занять в моем сердце то место, какое я отдала моему Фрэнку.
И все-таки, если бы я вышла замуж за лорда Сент-Саймона, я была бы ему верной женой. Мы
не вольны в нашей любви, но управлять своими поступками в нашей власти. Я шла с ним к алтарю с
твердым намерением исполнить свой долг, насколько это было в моих силах. Но вообразите себе, что
я почувствовала, когда, подойдя к алтарю и оглянувшись, вдруг увидела Фрэнка. Он стоял возле первой скамьи и смотрел прямо на меня. Сначала я подумала, что это призрак. Но когда я оглянулась
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
снова, он по-прежнему стоял там и взглядом словно спрашивал, рада я, что вижу его, или нет. Удивляюсь, как я не упала в обморок. Все кружилось передо мной, и слова священника доносились до меня, точно жужжание пчелы. Я не знала, как быть. Остановить брачную церемонию, решиться на
скандал в церкви? Я снова взглянула на него и, должно быть, он прочитал мои мысли, потому что
приложил палец к губам, как бы советуя молчать. Потом я увидела, как он торопливо пишет что-то
на клочке бумаги, и поняла, что эта записка предназначалась мне. Проходя мимо него я уронила букет, и он, возвращая цветы, успел сунуть мне в руку записку. В ней было всего несколько слов: он
просил, чтобы я вышла к нему, как только он подаст знак. У меня, конечно, не было и тени сомнения,
что теперь мой главный долг – повиноваться ему и делать все, что он скажет.
Придя домой, я все рассказала моей служанке, которая знала Фрэнка еще в Калифорнии и очень
любила его. Я велела ей молчать обо всем, сложить кое-что из самых необходимых вещей и приготовить мне пальто. Я знаю, мне следовало бы поговорить с лордом Сент-Саймоном, но это было так
трудно в присутствии его матери и всех этих важных гостей! И я решила, что сначала убегу, а потом
уже объяснюсь с ним. Мы просидели за столом минут десять, не больше, я вот, глядя в окно, я увидела Фрэнка, стоявшего на противоположном тротуаре. Он кивнул мне и зашагал по направлению к
парку. Я вышла из столовой, накинула пальто и пошла вслед за ним. На улице ко мне подошла какаято женщина и начала рассказывать что-то о лорде Сент-Саймоне. Я почти не слушала ее, но все же
уловила, что у него тоже была какая-то тайна до нашей женитьбы. Вскоре мне удалось отделаться от
этой женщины, и я нагнала Фрэнка. Мы сели в кэб и поехали на Гордон-сквер, где он успел снять
квартиру, и это была моя настоящая свадьба после стольких лет ожидания. Фрэнк, оказывается, попал в плен к апачам, бежал, приехал во Фриско, узнал, что я, считая его умершим, уехала в Англию,
поспешил вслед за мной сюда и наконец разыскал меня как раз в день моей второй свадьбы.
Some woman came talking about Lord St. Simon.
– Я прочитал о венчании в газетах, – пояснил американец.
– Там было указано название церкви и имя невесты, но не было ее адреса.
– Потом мы начали советоваться, как нам поступить. Фрэнк с самого начала стоял за то, чтобы
ничего не скрывать, но мне было так стыдно, что захотелось исчезнуть и никогда больше не встречать никого из этих людей, разве только написать несколько слов папе, чтоб он знал, что я жива и
здорова. Я с ужасом представляла себе, как все эти лорды и леди сидят за свадебным столом и ждут
моего возвращения. Итак, Фрэнк взял мое подвенечное платье и остальные вещи, связал их в узел,
чтобы никто не мог выследить меня, и отнес в такое место, где никто не мог бы их найти. По всей
вероятности, мы завтра же уехали бы в Париж, если бы сегодня к нам не пришел этот милый джентльмен, мистер Холмс, хотя каким чудом он нас нашел, просто уму непостижимо. Он доказал нам –
очень убедительно и мягко, – что я была не права, а Фрэнк прав и что мы сами себе повредим, если
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
будем скрываться. Потом он сказал, что может предоставить нам возможность поговорить с лордом
Сент-Саймоном без свидетелей, и вот мы здесь. Теперь, Роберт, вы знаете все. Мне очень, очень
жаль, если я причинила вам горе, но я надеюсь, что вы будете думать обо мне не так уж плохо.
Лорд Сент-Саймон слушал этот длинный рассказ все с тем же напряженным и холодным видом. Брови его были нахмурены, а губы сжаты.
– Прошу извинить меня, – сказал он, – но не в моих правилах обсуждать самые интимные свои
дела в присутствии посторонних.
– Так вы не хотите простить меня? Не хотите пожать мне руку на прощание?
– Нет, почему же, если это может доставить вам удовольствие.
И он холодно пожал протянутую ему руку.
– Я полагал, – начал было Холмс, – что вы не откажетесь поужинать с нами.
– Право, вы требуете от меня слишком многого, – возразил достойный лорд. – Я вынужден
примириться с обстоятельствами, но вряд ли можно ожидать, чтобы я стал радоваться тому, что произошло. С вашего позволения, я пожелаю вам приятного вечера.
Он сделал общий поклон и торжественно удалился.
«I will wish you all very good-night.»
– Но вы-то, надеюсь, удостоите меня своим обществом, – сказал Шерлок Холмс. – Мне, мистер
Маултон, всегда приятно видеть американца, ибо я из тех, кто верит, что недомыслие монарха и
ошибки министра,
25 имевшего место в давно минувшие годы, не помешают нашим детям превратиться когда-нибудь в граждан некой огромной страны, у которой будет единый флаг – англоамериканский.
– Интересный выдался случай, – заметил Холмс, когда гости ушли. – Он с очевидностью доказывает, как просто можно иной раз объяснить факты, которые на первый взгляд представляются почти необъяснимыми. Что может быть проще и естественнее ряда событий, о которых нам рассказала
молодая леди? И что может быть удивительнее тех выводов, которые легко сделать, если смотреть на
вещи, скажем, с точки зрения мистера Лестрейда из Скотланд-Ярда!
– Так вы, значит, были на правильном пути с самого начала?
– Для меня с самого начала были очевидны два факта: первый – что невеста шла к венцу совершенно добровольно и второй – что немедленно после венчания она уже раскаивалась о своем поступке. Ясно как день, что за это время произошло нечто, вызвавшее в ней такую перемену. Что же
это могло быть? Разговаривать с кем-либо вне дома у нее не было возможности, потому что жених ни
на секунду не расставался с нею. Но, может быть, она встретила кого-нибудь? Если так, это мог быть
только какой-нибудь американец: ведь в Англии она совсем недавно и вряд ли кто-нибудь здесь успел приобрести над ней такое огромное влияние, чтобы одним своим появлением заставить ее изме25 25Холмс имеет в виду английского короля Георга III (1738-1820) и премьер-министра Фредерика-Норта (1732-1792).
Политика Георга III и Норта привела к конфликту, а затем к войне с американскими колониями.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
нить все планы. Итак, методом исключения мы уже пришли к выводу, что она встретила какого-то
американца. Но кто же он был, этот американец, и почему встреча с ним так подействовала на нее?
По-видимому, это был либо возлюбленный, либо муж. Юность девушки прошла, как известно, среди
суровых людей в весьма своеобразной обстановке. Все это я понял еще до рассказа лорда СентСаймона. А когда он сообщил нам о мужчине, оказавшемся в церкви, о том, как невеста переменила
свое обращение с ним самим, как она уронила букет – испытанный способ получения записок, – о
разговоре леди Сент-Саймон с любимой горничной и о ее многозначительном намеке на «захват чужого участка» (а на языке золотопромышленников это означает посягательство на то, чем уже завладел другой), все стало для меня совершенно ясно. Она сбежала с мужчиной, и этот мужчина был либо ее возлюбленным, либо мужем, причем последнее казалось более вероятным.
– Но каким чудом вам удалось разыскать их?
– Это, пожалуй, было бы трудновато, но мой друг Лестрейд, сам того не понимая, оказался обладателем ценнейшей информации. Инициалы, разумеется, тоже имели большое значение, но еще
важнее было узнать, что на этой неделе человек с такими инициалами останавливался в одной из
лучших лондонских гостиниц.
– А как вы установили, что это была одна из лучших?
– Очень просто: по ценам. Восемь шиллингов за номер и восемь пенсов за стакан хереса берут
только в первоклассных гостиницах, а их в Лондоне не так много. Уже во второй гостинице, которую
я посетил, на Нортумберленд-авеню, я узнал из книги для приезжающих, что некто мистер Фрэнсис
X. Маултон, из Америки, выехал оттуда как раз накануне. А просмотрев его счета, я нашел те самые
цифры, которые видел в копии счета. Свою корреспонденцию он распорядился пересылать по адресу: Гордон-сквер, 226, куда я и направился. Мне посчастливилось застать влюбленную пару дома, и я
отважился дать молодым несколько отеческих советов. Мне удалось доказать им, что они только выиграют, если разъяснят широкой публике и особенно лорду Сент-Саймону, создавшееся положения Я
пригласил их сюда, пообещав им встречу с лордом, и, как видите, мне удалось убедить его явиться на
это свидание
– Но результаты не блестящи, – заметил я. – Он бы не слишком любезен.
– Ах, Уотсон, – с улыбкой возразил мне Холмс, – пожалуй, вы тоже были бы не слишком любезны, если бы после всех хлопот, связанных с ухаживанием и со свадьбой, оказались вдруг и без
жены, и без состояния. По-моему, мы должны быть крайне снисходительны к лорду Сент-Саймону и
благодарить судьбу за то, что, по всей видимости, никогда не окажемся в его положении… Передайте мне скрипку и садитесь поближе. Ведь теперь у нас осталась неразгаданной только одна проблема
– как мы будем убивать время в эти темные осенние вечера.
Берилловая диадема
The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet
First published in the Strand Magazine, May 1892,
with 9 illustrations by Sidney Paget.
– Посмотрите-ка, Холмс, – сказал я. – Какой-то сумасшедший бежит. Не понимаю, как родные
отпускают такого без присмотра.
Я стоял у сводчатого окна нашей комнаты и глядел вниз, на Бейкер-стрит.
Холмс лениво поднялся с кресла, встал у меня за спиной и, засунув руки в карманы халата,
взглянул в окно.
Было ясное февральское утро. Выпавший вчера снег лежал плотным слоем, сверкая в лучах
зимнего солнца. На середине улицы снег превратился в бурую грязную массу, но по обочинам он оставался белым, как будто только что выпал. Хотя тротуары уже очистили, было все же очень скользко, и пешеходов на улице было меньше, чем обычно. Сейчас на улице на всем протяжении от стан-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
ции подземки до нашего дома находился только один человек. Его эксцентричное поведение и привлекло мое внимание.
Это был мужчина лет пятидесяти, высокий, солидный, с широким энергичным лицом и представительной фигурой. Одет он был богато, но не броско: блестящий цилиндр, темный сюртук из дорогого материала, хорошо сшитые светло-серые брюки и коричневые гетры. Однако все его поведение решительно не соответствовало его внешности и одежде. Он бежал, то и дело подскакивая, как
человек, не привыкший к физическим упражнениям, размахивал руками, вертел головой, лицо его
искажалось гримасами.
– Что с ним? – недоумевал я. – Он, кажется, ищет какой-то дом.
– Я думаю, что он спешит сюда, – сказал Холмс, потирая руки.
– Сюда?
– Да. Полагаю, ему нужно посоветоваться со мной. Все признаки налицо. Ну, прав я был или
нет?
В это время незнакомец, тяжело дыша, кинулся к нашей двери и принялся судорожно дергать
колокольчик, огласив звоном весь дом.
Через минуту он вбежал в комнату, едва переводя дух и жестикулируя. В глазах у него затаилось такое горе и отчаяние, что наши улыбки погасли и насмешка уступила место глубокому сочувствию и жалости. Сначала он не мог вымолвить ни слова, только раскачивался взад и вперед и хватал
себя за голову, как человек, доведенный до грани сумасшествия. Вдруг он бросился к стене и ударился о нее головой. Мы кинулись к нашему посетителю и оттащили его на середину комнаты.
Холмс усадил несчастного в кресло, сам сел напротив и, похлопав его по руке, заговорил так мягко и
успокаивающе, как никто, кроме него, не умел.
With look of grief and despair.
– Вы пришли ко мне, чтобы рассказать, что с вами случилось? – сказал он. – Вы утомились от
быстрой ходьбы. Успокойтесь, придите в себя, и я с радостью выслушаю вас, что вы имеете сказать.
Незнакомцу потребовалась минута или больше того, чтобы отдышаться и побороть волнение.
Наконец он провел платком по лбу, решительно сжал губы и повернулся к нам.
– Вы, конечно, сочли меня за сумасшедшего? – спросил он.
– Нет, но я вижу, что с вами стряслась беда, – ответил Холмс.
– Да, видит Бог! Беда такая неожиданная и страшная, что можно сойти с ума. Я вынес бы бесчестье, хотя на моей совести нет ни единого пятнышка. Личное несчастье – это случается с каждым.
Но одновременно и то и другое, да еще в такой ужасной форме! Кроме того, это касается не только
меня. Если не будет немедленно найден выход из моего бедственного положения, может пострадать
одна из знатнейших персон нашей страны.
– Успокойтесь, сэр, прошу вас, – сказал Холмс. – Расскажите, кто вы и что с вами случилось.
– Мое имя, возможно, известно вам, – проговорил посетитель. – Я Александр Холдер из банкирского дома «Холдер и Стивенсон» на Тренидл-стрит.
Действительно, имя было хорошо знакомо нам; оно принадлежало старшему компаньону вто-
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
рой по значению банкирской фирмы в Лондоне. Что же привело в такое жалкое состояние одного из
виднейших граждан столицы? Мы с нетерпением ждали ответа на этот вопрос. Огромным усилием
воли Холдер взял себя в руки и приступил к рассказу.
– Я понимаю, что нельзя терять ни минуты. Как только полицейский инспектор порекомендовал мне обратиться к вам, я немедленно поспешил сюда. Я добрался до Бейкер-стрит подземкой и
всю дорогу от станции бежал: по такому снегу кэбы движутся очень медленно. Я вообще мало двигаюсь и потому так запыхался. Но сейчас мне стало лучше, и я постараюсь изложить все факты как
можно короче и яснее.
Вам, конечно, известно, что в банковском деле очень многое зависит от умения удачно вкладывать средства и в то же время расширять клиентуру. Один из наиболее выгодных способов инвестирования средств – выдача ссуд под солидное обеспечение. За последние годы мы немало успели в
этом отношении. Мы ссужаем крупными суммами знатные семейства под обеспечение картинами,
фамильными библиотеками, сервизами.
Вчера утром я сидел в своем кабинете в банке, и кто-то из клерков принес мне визитную карточку. Я вздрогнул, прочитав имя, потому что это был не кто иной, как… Впрочем, пожалуй, даже
вам я не решусь его назвать. Это имя известно всему миру; имя одной из самых высокопоставленных
и знатных особ Англии. Я был ошеломлен оказанной мне честью, и когда он вошел, хотел было выразить свои чувства высокому посетителю. Но он прервал меня: ему, видно, хотелось как можно быстрее уладить неприятное для него дело.
– Мистер Холдер, я слышал, что вы предоставляете ссуды.
– Да. Фирма дает ссуды под надежные гарантии, – отвечал я.
– Мне совершенно необходимы пятьдесят тысяч фунтов стерлингов, и притом немедленно, –
заявил он. – Конечно, такую небольшую сумму я мог бы одолжить у своих друзей, но я предпочитаю
сделать этот заем в деловом порядке. И я вынужден сам заниматься этим. Вы, конечно, понимаете,
что человеку моего положения неудобно вмешивать в это дело посторонних.
– Позвольте узнать, на какой срок вам нужны деньги? – осведомился я.
– В будущий понедельник мне вернут крупную сумму денег, и я погашу вашу ссуду с уплатой
любого процента. Но мне крайне важно получить деньги сразу.
– Я был бы счастлив безоговорочно дать вам деньги из своих личных средств, но это довольно
крупная сумма, так что придется сделать это от имени фирмы. Элементарная справедливость по отношению к моему компаньону требует, чтобы я принял меры деловой предосторожности.
– Иначе и быть не может, – сказал он и взял в руки квадратный футляр черного сафьяна, который перед тем положил на стол возле себя. – Вы, конечно, слышали о знаменитой берилловой диадеме?
– Разумеется. Это – национальное достояние.
– Совершенно верно. – Он открыл футляр – на мягком розовом бархате красовалось великолепнейшее произведение ювелирного искусства.
– В диадеме тридцать девять крупных бериллов, – сказал он. – Ценность золотой оправы не
поддается исчислению. Самая минимальная ее стоимость вдвое выше нужной мне суммы. Я готов
оставить диадему у вас.
Я взял в руки футляр с драгоценной диадемой и с некоторым колебанием поднял глаза на своего именитого посетителя.
– Вы сомневаетесь в ценности диадемы? – улыбнулся он.
– О, что вы, я сомневаюсь лишь…
–…удобно ли мне оставить эту диадему вам? Можете не беспокоиться. Мне эта мысль и в голову не пришла, не будь я абсолютно убежден, что через четыре дня получу диадему обратно. Пустая
формальность! Ну, а само обеспечение вы считаете удовлетворительным?
– Вполне.
– Вы, разумеется, понимаете, мистер Холдер, что мой поступок – свидетельство глубочайшего
доверия, которое я питаю к вам. Это доверие основано на том, что я знаю о вас. Я рассчитываю на
вашу скромность, на то, что вы воздержитесь от каких-либо разговоров о диадеме. Прошу вас также
беречь ее особенно тщательно, так как любое повреждение вызовет скандал. Оно повлечет почти такие же катастрофические последствия, как и пропажа диадемы. В мире больше нет таких бериллов,
и, если потеряется хоть один, возместить его будет нечем. Но я доверяю вам и со спокойной душой
оставляю у вас диадему. Я вернусь за нею лично в понедельник утром.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Видя, что мой клиент спешит, я без дальнейших разговоров вызвал кассира и распорядился выдать пятьдесят банковских билетов по тысяче фунтов стерлингов.
«I took the precious case.»
Оставшись один и разглядывая драгоценность, лежащую на моем письменном столе, я подумал
об огромной ответственности, которую принял на себя. В случае пропажи диадемы, несомненно, разразится невероятный скандал: ведь она достояние нации! Я даже начал сожалеть, что впутался в это
дело. Но сейчас уже ничего нельзя было изменить. Я запер диадему в свой личный сейф и вернулся к
работе.
Когда настал вечер, я подумал, что было бы опрометчиво оставлять в банке такую драгоценность. Кому не известны случаи взлома сейфов? А вдруг взломают и мой? В каком ужасном положении я окажусь, случись такая беда! И я решил держать диадему при себе. Затем я вызвал кэб и поехал
домой в Стритем с футляром в кармане. Я не мог успокоиться, пока не поднялся к себе наверх и не
запер диадему в бюро в комнате, смежной с моей спальней.
А теперь два слова о людях, живущих в моем доме. Я хочу, чтобы вы, мистер Холмс, полностью ознакомились с положением дел. Мой конюх и мальчик-слуга – приходящие работники, поэтому о них можно не говорить. У меня три горничные, работающие уже много лет, и их абсолютная
честность не вызывает ни малейшего сомнения. Четвертая – Люси Парр, официантка, живет у нас
только несколько месяцев. Она поступила с прекрасной рекомендацией и вполне справляется со своей работой. Люси – хорошенькая девушка, у нее есть поклонники, которые слоняются возле дома.
Это – единственное, что мне не нравится. Впрочем, я считаю ее вполне порядочной девушкой во всех
отношениях.
Вот и все, что касается слуг. Моя собственная семья так немногочисленна, что мне не придется
много о ней говорить. Я вдовец и имею единственного сына Артура. К великому моему огорчению,
он обманул мои надежды. Нет ни малейшего сомнения, что виноват я сам. Говорят, я избаловал его.
Очень может быть. Когда скончалась жена, я понял, что теперь сын – моя единственная привязанность. Я не мог ему отказать ни в чем, я совершенно не мог выносить даже малейшего его неудовольствия. Может быть, для нас обоих было бы лучше, будь я с ним хоть чуточку построже. Но в то
время я думал иначе.
Естественно, я мечтал, что Артур когда-нибудь сменит меня в моем деле. Однако у него не оказалось никакой склонности к этому. Он стал необузданным, своенравным, и, говоря по совести, я не
мог доверить ему большие деньги. Юношей он вступил в аристократический клуб, а позже благодаря
обаятельным манерам стал своим человеком в кругу самых богатых и расточительных людей. Он
пристрастился к крупной игре в карты, проматывал деньги на скачках и поэтому все чаще и чаще обращался ко мне с просьбой дать ему денег – в счет будущих карманных расходов. Деньги нужны были для того, чтобы расплатиться с карточными долгами. Правда, Артур неоднократно пытался отойти
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
от этой компании, но каждый раз влияние его друга сэра Джорджа Бэрнвелла возвращало его на
прежний путь.
Собственно говоря, меня не очень удивляет, что сэр Джордж Бэрнвелл оказывал такое влияние
на моего сына. Артур нередко приглашал его к нам, и должен сказать, что даже я подпадал под обаяние сэра Джорджа. Он старше Артура, светский человек до мозга костей, интереснейший собеседник,
много поездивший и повидавший на своем веку, к тому же человек исключительно привлекательной
внешности. Но все же, думая о нем спокойно, отвлекаясь от его личного обаяния и вспоминая его
циничные высказывания и взгляды, я сознавал, что сэру Джорджу нельзя доверять.
Так думал не только я – того же взгляда придерживалась и Мэри, обладающая тонкой женской
интуицией.
Теперь остается рассказать лишь о Мэри, моей племяннице. Когда лет пять тому назад умер
брат и она осталась одна на всем свете, я взял ее к себе. С тех пор она для меня словно родная дочь.
Мэри – солнечный луч в моем доме – такая ласковая, чуткая, милая, какой только может быть женщина, и к тому же превосходная хозяйка. Мэри – моя правая рука, я не могу себе представить, что я
делал бы без нее. И только в одном она шла против моей воли. Мой сын Артур любит ее и дважды
просил ее руки, но она каждый раз отказывала ему. Я глубоко убежден, что если хоть кто-нибудь
способен направить моего сына на путь истинный, так это только она. Брак с ней мог бы изменить
всю его жизнь… но сейчас, увы, слишком поздно. Все погибло!
Ну вот, мистер Холмс, теперь вы знаете людей, которые живут под моей крышей, и я продолжу
свою печальную повесть.
Когда в тот вечер после обеда мы пили кофе в гостиной, я рассказал Артуру и Мэри, какое сокровище находится у нас в доме. Я, конечно, не назвал имени клиента. Люси Парр, подававшая нам
кофе, к тому времени уже вышла из комнаты. Я твердо уверен в этом, хотя не берусь утверждать, что
дверь за ней была плотно закрыта. Мэри и Артур, заинтригованные моим рассказом, хотели посмотреть знаменитую диадему, но я почел за благо не прикасаться к ней.
– Куда же ты ее положил? – спросил Артур.
– В бюро.
– Будем надеяться, что сегодня ночью к нам не вломятся грабители, – сказал он.
– Бюро заперто на ключ, – возразил я.
– Пустяки! К нему подойдет любой ключ. В детстве я сам открывал его ключом от буфета.
Он часто нес всякий вздор, и я не придал значения его словам.
«Oh, any old key will fit that bureau.»
После кофе Артур с мрачным видом последовал в мою комнату.
– Послушай, папа, – сказал он, опустив глаза. – Не мог бы ты одолжить мне двести фунтов?
– Ни в коем случае, – ответил я резко. – Я и так слишком распустил тебя в денежных делах.
– Да, ты всегда щедр, – сказал он. – Но сейчас мне крайне нужна эта сумма, иначе я не смогу
показаться в клубе.
– Тем лучше! – воскликнул я.
– Но меня же могут посчитать за нечестного человека! Я не вынесу такого позора. Так или иначе я должен достать деньги. Если ты не дашь мне двести фунтов, я буду вынужден раздобыть их
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
иным способом.
Я возмутился: за последний месяц он третий раз обращался ко мне с подобной просьбой.
– Ты не получишь ни фартинга! – закричал я.
Он поклонился и вышел из комнаты, не сказав ни слова. После ухода Артура я заглянул в бюро,
убедился, что драгоценность на месте, и снова запер его на ключ.
Затем я решил обойти комнаты и посмотреть, все ли в порядке. Обычно эту обязанность берет
на себя Мэри, но сегодня я решил, что лучше сделать это самому. Спускаясь с лестницы, я увидел
свою племянницу – она закрывала окно в гостиной.
– Скажите, папа, вы разрешили Люси отлучиться? – Мне показалось, что Мэри немножко
встревожена. – Об этом и речи не было.
– Она только что вошла через черный ход. Думаю, что она выходила к калитке повидаться с
кем-нибудь. Мне кажется, это ни к чему, и пора это прекратить.
– Непременно поговори с ней завтра, или, если хочешь, я сам это сделаю. Ты проверила, все
хорошо заперто?
– Да, папа.
– Тогда спокойной ночи, дитя мое. – Я поцеловал ее отправился к себе в спальню и вскоре уснул.
– Я подробно говорю обо всем, что может иметь хоть какое-нибудь отношение к делу, мистер
Холмс. Но, если что-либо покажется вам неясным, спрашивайте, не стесняйтесь.
– Нет, нет, вы рассказываете вполне ясно, – ответил Холмс.
– Сейчас я перехожу к той части рассказа, которую хотел бы изложить особенно детально.
Обычно я сплю не очень крепко, а беспокойство в тот раз отнюдь не способствовало крепкому сну.
Около двух часов ночи я проснулся от какого-то слабого шума. Шум прекратился прежде, чем я сообразил, в чем дело, но у меня создалось впечатление, что где-то осторожно закрыли окно. Я весь обратился в слух. Вдруг до меня донеслись легкие шаги в комнате рядом с моей спальней. Я выскользнул из постели и, дрожа от страха, выглянул за дверь.
– Артур! – закричал я. – Негодяй! Вор! Как ты посмел притронуться к диадеме!
Газ был притушен, и при его свете я увидел своего несчастного сына – на нем была только рубашка и брюки. Он стоял около газовой горелки и держал в руках диадему. Мне показалось, что он
старался согнуть ее или сломать. Услышав меня, Артур выронил диадему и повернулся ко мне, бледный как смерть. Я схватил сокровище: не хватало золотого зубца с тремя бериллами.
At my cry he dropped it.
– Подлец! – закричал я вне себя от ярости. – Сломать такую вещь! Ты обесчестил меня, понимаешь? Куда ты дел камни, которые украл?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Украл? – попятился он.
– Да, украл! Ты вор! – кричал я, тряся его за плечи.
– Нет, не может быть, ничего не могло пропасть! – бормотал он.
– Тут недостает трех камней. Где они? Ты, оказывается, не только вор, но и лжец! Я же видел,
как ты пытался отломить еще кусок.
– Хватит! Я больше не намерен терпеть оскорбления, – холодно сказал Артур. – Ты не услышишь от меня ни слова. Утром я ухожу из дому и буду сам устраиваться в жизни.
– Ты уйдешь из моего дома только в сопровождении полиции! – кричал я, обезумев от горя и
гнева. – Я хочу знать все, абсолютно все!
– Я не скажу ни слова! – неожиданно взорвался он. – Если ты считаешь нужным вызвать полицию – пожалуйста, пусть ищут!
Я кричал так, что поднял на ноги весь дом. Мэри первой вбежала в комнату. Увидев диадему и
растерянного Артура, она все поняла и, вскрикнув, упала без чувств. Я послал горничную за полицией. Когда прибыли полицейский инспектор и констебль, Артур, мрачно стоявший со скрещенными
руками, спросил меня, неужели я действительно собираюсь предъявить ему обвинение в воровстве. Я
ответил, что это дело отнюдь не частное, что диадема – собственность нации и что я твердо решил
дать делу законный ход.
– Но ты по крайней мере не дашь им арестовать меня сейчас же, – сказал он. – Во имя наших
общих интересов разреши мне отлучиться из дому хотя бы на пять минут.
– Для того, чтобы ты скрылся или получше припрятал краденое? – воскликнул я.
Я понимал весь ужас своего положения и заклинал его подумать о том, что на карту поставлено
не только мое имя, но и честь гораздо более высокого лица, что исчезновение бериллов вызовет огромный скандал, который потрясет всю нацию. Всего можно избежать, если только он скажет, что он
сделал с тремя камнями.
– Пойми, – говорил я. – Ты задержан на месте преступления. Признание не усугубит твою вину.
Напротив, если ты вернешь бериллы, то поможешь исправить создавшееся положение и тебя простят.
– Приберегите свое прощение для тех, кто в нем нуждается,
– сказал он высокомерно и отвернулся.
Я видел, что он крайне ожесточен, и понял, что дальнейшие уговоры бесполезны. Оставался
один выход. Я пригласил инспектора, и тот взял Артура под стражу.
Полицейские немедленно обыскали Артура и его комнату, обшарили каждый закоулок в доме,
но обнаружить драгоценные камни не удалось, а негодный мальчишка не раскрывал рта, несмотря на
наши увещевания и угрозы. Сегодня утром его отправили в тюрьму. А я, закончив формальности,
поспешил к вам. Умоляю вас применить все свое искусство, чтобы раскрыть это дело. В полиции мне
откровенно сказали, что в настоящее время вряд ли смогут чем-нибудь помочь мне. Я не остановлюсь ни перед какими расходами. Я уже предложил вознаграждение в тысячу фунтов… Боже! Что
же мне делать? Я потерял честь, состояние и сына в одну ночь… О, что мне делать?!
Он схватился за голову и, раскачиваясь из стороны в сторону, бормотал, как ребенок, который
не в состоянии выразить свое горе.
Несколько минут Холмс сидел молча, нахмурив брови и устремив взгляд на огонь в камине.
– У вас часто бывают гости? – спросил он.
– Нет, у нас никого не бывает, иногда разве придет компаньон с женой да изредка кто-либо из
друзей Артура. Недавно к нам несколько раз заглядывал сэр Джордж Бэрнвелл. Больше никого.
– А вы сами часто бываете в обществе?
– Артур – часто. А мы с Мэри всегда дома. Мы оба домоседы.
– Это необычно для молодой девушки.
– Она не очень общительная и к тому же не такая уж юная. Ей двадцать четыре года.
– Вы говорите, что случившееся явилось для нее ударом?
– О да! Она потрясена больше меня.
– А у вас не появлялось сомнения в виновности Артура?
– Какие же могут быть сомнения, когда я собственными глазами видел диадему в руках у Артура?
– Я не считаю это решающим доказательством вины. Скажите, кроме отломанного зубца, были
какие-нибудь еще повреждения на диадеме?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Она была погнута.
– А вам не приходила мысль, что ваш сын просто пытался распрямить ее?
– Что вы! Я понимаю, вы хотите оправдать его в моих глазах. Но это невозможно. Что он делал
в моей комнате? Если он не имел преступных намерений, отчего он молчит?
– Все это верно. Но, с другой стороны, если он виновен, то почему бы ему не попытаться придумать какую-нибудь версию в свое оправдание? То обстоятельство, что он не хочет говорить, помоему, исключает оба предположения. И вообще тут есть несколько неясных деталей. Что думает
полиция о шуме, который вас разбудил?
– Они считают, что Артур, выходя из спальни, неосторожно стукнул дверью.
– Очень похоже! Человек, идущий на преступление, хлопает дверью, чтобы разбудить весь
дом! А что они думают по поводу исчезнувших камней?
– Они и сейчас еще простукивают стены и обследуют мебель.
– А они не пытались искать вне дома?
– Они проявили исключительную энергию. Они прочесали весь сад.
– Ну, дорогой мистер Холдер, – сказал Холмс, – разве не очевидно, что все гораздо сложнее,
чем предполагаете вы и полиция? Вы считаете дело ясным, а с моей точки зрения это очень запутанная история. Судите сами, по-вашему, ход событий таков: Артур поднимается с постели, пробирается
с большим риском в ту комнату, открывает бюро и достает диадему, отламывает с большим трудом
зубец, выходит и где-то прячет три берилла из тридцати девяти, причем с такой ловкостью, что никто
не может их разыскать, затем вновь возвращается в вашу комнату, подвергая себя огромному риску:
ведь его могут застать там. Неужели такая версия в самом деле кажется вам правдоподобной?
– Но тогда я ума не приложу, что могло случиться! – воскликнул банкир в отчаянии. – Если он
не имел дурных намерений, почему он молчит?
– А вот это уже наше дело – разгадать загадку, – ответил Холмс. – Теперь, мистер Холдер, мы
отправимся вместе с вами в Стритем и потратим часок-другой, чтобы на месте познакомиться с коекакими обстоятельствами.
Мой друг настоял, чтобы я сопровождал его. И я охотно согласился: эта странная история вызвала у меня предельное любопытство и глубокую симпатию к несчастному мистеру Холдеру. Говоря откровенно, виновность Артура казалась мне, как и нашему клиенту, совершенно бесспорной, и
все же я верил в чутье Холмса: если мой друг не удовлетворился объяснениями Холдера, значит, есть
какая-то надежда.
Пока мы ехали к южной окраине Лондона, Холмс не проронил ни слова. Погруженный в глубокое раздумье, он сидел, опустив голову на грудь и надвинув шляпу на самые глаза. Наш клиент, напротив, казалось, воспрянул духом от слабого проблеска надежды и даже пытался завести со мной
разговор о своих банковских делах. В пути мы были недолго: непродолжительная поездка по железной дороге, краткая прогулка пешком – и вот мы уже в Фэрбенке, скромной резиденции богатого финансиста.
Фэрбенк – большой квадратный дом из белого камня, расположенный недалеко от шоссе, с которым его соединяет только дорога для экипажей. Сейчас эта дорога, упирающаяся в массивные железные ворота, была занесена снегом. Направо от нее – густые заросли кустарника, за ними – узкая
тропинка, по обе стороны которой живая изгородь; тропинка ведет к кухне, и ею пользуются главным образом поставщики продуктов. Налево – дорожка к конюшне. Она, собственно говоря, не входит во владения Фэрбенка и является общественной собственностью. Впрочем, там очень редко
можно встретить посторонних.
Холмс не вошел в дом вместе с нами; он медленно двинулся вдоль фасада, по дорожке, ведущей на кухню и дальше через сад, в сторону конюшни. Мистер Холдер и я так и не дождались Холмса; войдя в дом, мы молча расположились в столовой около камина. Внезапно дверь отворилась, и в
комнату тихо вошла молодая девушка. Она была немного выше среднего роста, стройная, с темными
волосами и глазами. Эти глаза казались еще темнее оттого, что в лице ее не было ни кровинки. Мне
никогда еще не приходилось видеть такой мертвенной бледности. Губы тоже были совсем белые,
глаза заплаканы. Казалось, что она сильнее потрясена горем, чем даже мистер Холдер. В то же время
черты ее лица говорили о сильной воле и огромном самообладании.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
She went straight to her uncle.
Не обращая на меня внимания, она подошла к дяде и нежно провела рукой по его волосам.
– Вы распорядились, чтобы Артура освободили, папа? – спросила она.
– Нет, моя девочка, дело надо расследовать до конца.
– Я глубоко убеждена, что он не виновен. Мне сердце подсказывает это. Он не мог сделать ничего дурного. Вы потом сами пожалеете, что обошлись с ним так сурово.
– Но почему же он молчит, если не виновен?
– Возможно, он обиделся, что вы подозреваете его в краже.
– Как же не подозревать, если я застал его с диадемой в руках?
– Он взял диадему в руки, чтобы посмотреть. Поверьте, папа, он не виновен. Пожалуйста, прекратите это дело. Как ужасно, что наш дорогой Артур в тюрьме!
– Я не прекращу дела, пока не будут найдены бериллы. Ты настолько привязана к Артуру, что
забываешь об ужасных последствиях. Нет, Мэри, я не отступлюсь, напротив, я пригласил джентльмена из Лондона для самого тщательного расследования.
– Это вы? – Мэри повернулась ко мне.
– Нет, это его друг. Тот джентльмен попросил, чтобы мы оставили его одного. Он хотел пройти
по дорожке, которая ведет к конюшне.
– К конюшне? – Ее темные брови удивленно поднялись. – Что он думает там найти? А вот, очевидно, и он сам. Я надеюсь, сэр, что вам удастся доказать непричастность моего кузена к этому преступлению. Я убеждена в этом.
– Я полностью разделяю ваше мнение, – сказал Холмс, стряхивая у половика снег с ботинок. –
Полагаю, я имею честь говорить с мисс Холдер? Вы позволите задать вам несколько вопросов?
– Ради Бога, сэр! Если б только мои ответы помогли распутать это ужасное дело!
– Вы ничего не слышали сегодня ночью?
– Ничего, пока до меня не донесся громкий голос дяди, и тогда я спустилась вниз.
– Накануне вечером вы закрывали окна и двери. Хорошо ли вы их заперли?
– Да.
– И они были заперты сегодня утром?
– Да.
– У вашей горничной есть поклонник. Вчера вечером вы говорили дяде, что она выходила к нему?
– Да, она подавала нам вчера кофе. Она могла слышать, как дядя рассказывал о диадеме.
– Понимаю. Отсюда вы делаете вывод, что она могла что-то сообщить своему поклоннику и
они вместе замыслили кражу.
– Ну какой прок от всех этих туманных предположений? – нетерпеливо воскликнул мистер
Холдер. – Ведь я же сказал, что застал Артура с диадемой в руках.
– Не надо спешить, мистер Холдер. К этому мы еще вернемся. Теперь относительно вашей прислуги. Мисс Холдер, она вошла в дом через кухню?
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Да. Я спустилась посмотреть, заперта ли дверь, и увидела Люси у порога. Заметила в темноте
и ее поклонника.
– Вы знаете его?
– Да, он зеленщик, приносит нам овощи. Его зовут Фрэнсис Проспер.
– И он стоял немного в стороне, не у самой двери?
– Да.
– И у него деревянная нога?
Что-то вроде испуга промелькнуло в выразительных черных глазах девушки.
– Вы волшебник, – сказала она. – Как вы это узнали? – Она улыбнулась, но на худощавом энергичном лице Холмса не появилось ответной улыбки.
– Я хотел бы подняться наверх, – сказал он. – Впрочем, сначала я посмотрю окна.
Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's eyes.
Он быстро обошел первый этаж, переходя от одного окна к другому, затем остановился у
большого окна, которое выходило на дорожку, ведущую к конюшне. Он открыл окно и тщательно, с
помощью сильной лупы осмотрел подоконник. – Что ж, теперь пойдемте наверх, – сказал он наконец.
Комната, расположенная рядом со спальней банкира, выглядела очень скромно: серый ковер,
большое бюро и высокое зеркало. Холмс первым делом подошел к бюро и тщательно осмотрел замочную скважину.
– Каким ключом отперли его? – спросил он.
– Тем самым, о котором говорил мой сын, – от буфета в чулане.
– Где ключ?
– Вон он, на туалетном столике.
Холмс взял ключ и открыл бюро.
– Замок бесшумный, – сказал он. – Не удивительно, что вы не проснулись. В этом футляре, я
полагаю, и находится диадема? Посмотрим… – Он открыл футляр, извлек диадему и положил на
стол. Это было чудесное произведение ювелирного искусства. Таких изумительных камней мне никогда не приходилось видеть. Один зубец диадемы был отломан.
– Вот этот зубец соответствует отломанному, – сказал Холмс. – Будьте любезны, мистер Холдер, попробуйте отломить его.
– Боже меня сохрани! – воскликнул банкир, в ужасе отшатнувшись от Холмса.
– Ну, так попробую я. – Холмс напряг все силы, но попытка оказалась безуспешной. – Немного
поддается, но мне, пожалуй, пришлось бы долго повозиться, чтоб отломить зубец, хотя руки у меня
очень сильные. Человеку с обычным физическим развитием это вообще не под силу. Но допустим,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
что я все же сломал диадему. Раздался бы треск, как выстрел из пистолета. Неужели вы полагаете,
мистер Холдер, что это произошло чуть ли не над вашим ухом и вы ничего не услышали?
– Уж не знаю, что и думать. Мне все это совершенно непонятно.
– Как знать, может быть все разъяснится. А что вы думаете, мисс Холдер?
– Признаюсь, я разделяю недоумение моего дяди.
– Скажите, мистер Холдер, были ли в тот момент на ногах вашего сына ботинки или туфли?
– Нет, он был босой, на нем были только брюки и рубашка.
– Благодарю вас. Ну что ж, нам просто везет, и если мы не раскроем тайну, то только по нашей
собственной вине. С вашего разрешения, мистер Холдер, я еще раз обойду вокруг дома.
Холмс вышел один: лишние следы, по его словам, только затрудняют работу.
Он пропадал около часу, а когда вернулся, ноги у него были все в снегу, а лицо непроницаемо,
как обычно.
– Мне кажется, я осмотрел все, что нужно, – сказал он, – и могу отправиться домой.
– Ну, а как же камни, мистер Холмс, где они? – воскликнул банкир.
– Этого я сказать не могу.
Банкир в отчаянии заломил руки.
– Неужели они безвозвратно пропали? – простонал он. – А как же Артур? Дайте хоть самую
маленькую надежду!
– Мое мнение о вашем сыне не изменилось.
– Ради всего святого, что же произошло в моем доме?
– Если вы посетите меня на Бейкер-стрит завтра утром между девятью и десятью, я думаю, что
смогу дать более подробные объяснения. Надеюсь, вы предоставите мне свободу действий при условии, разумеется, что камни будут возвращены, и не постоите за расходами?
– Я отдал бы все свое состояние!
– Прекрасно. Я подумаю над этой историей. До свидания. Возможно, я еще загляну сегодня
сюда.
Было совершенно ясно, что Холмс уже что-то надумал, но я даже приблизительно не мог представить себе, к каким выводам он пришел. По дороге в Лондон я несколько раз пытался навести беседу на эту тему, но Холмс всякий раз уходил от ответа. Наконец, отчаявшись, я прекратил свои попытки. Не было еще и трех часов, когда мы возвратились домой. Холмс поспешно ушел в свою
комнату и через несколько минут снова появился. Он успел переодеться. Потрепанное пальто с поднятым воротником, небрежно повязанный красный шарф и стоптанные башмаки придавали ему вид
типичного бродяги.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Dressed as a common loafer.
– Ну, так, я думаю, сойдет, – сказал он, взглянув в зеркало над камином. – Хотелось бы взять с
собою и вас, Уотсон, но это невозможно. На верном пути я или нет, скоро узнаем. Думаю, что вернусь через несколько часов. – Он открыл буфет, отрезал кусок говядины, положил его между двумя
кусками хлеба и, засунув сверток в карман, ушел.
Я только что закончил пить чай, когда Холмс возвратился в прекрасном настроении, размахивая каким-то старым ботинком. Он швырнул его в угол и налил себе чашку.
– Я заглянул на минутку, сейчас отправлюсь дальше.
– Куда же?
– На другой конец Вест-Энда. Вернусь, возможно, не скоро. Не ждите меня, если я запоздаю.
– Как успехи?
– Ничего, пожаловаться не могу. Я был в Стритеме, но в дом не заходил. Интересное дельце, не
хотелось бы упустить его. Хватит, однако, болтать, надо сбросить это тряпье и снова стать приличным человеком.
По поведению моего друга я видел, что он доволен результатами. Глаза у него блестели, на
бледных щеках, даже появился слабый румянец. Он поднялся к себе в комнату, и через несколько
минут я услышал, как стукнула входная дверь. Холмс снова отправился на «охоту».
Я ждал до полуночи, но, видя, что его все нет и нет, отправился спать. Холмс имел обыкновение исчезать на долгое время, когда нападал на след, так что меня ничуть не удивило его опоздание.
Не знаю, в котором часу он вернулся, но, когда на следующее утро я вышел к завтраку, Холмс сидел
за столом с чашкой кофе в одной руке и газетой в другой. Как всегда, он был бодр и подтянут.
– Простите, Уотсон, что я начал завтрак без вас, – сказал он. – Но вот-вот явится наш клиент.
– Да, уже десятый час, – ответил я. – Кажется, звонят? Наверное, это он.
И в самом деле это был мистер Холдер. Меня поразила перемена, происшедшая в нем. Обычно
массивное и энергичное лицо его осунулось и как-то сморщилось, волосы, казалось, побелели еще
больше. Он вошел усталой походкой, вялый, измученный, что представляло еще более тягостное
зрелище, чем его бурное отчаяние вчерашним утром. Тяжело опустившись в придвинутое мною
кресло, он проговорил:
– Не знаю, за что такая кара! Два дня назад я был счастливым, процветающим человеком, а
сейчас опозорен и обречен на одинокую старость. Беда не приходит одна. Исчезла Мэри.
– Исчезла?
– Да. Постель ее не тронута, комната пуста, а на столе вот эта записка. Вчера я сказал ей, что,
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
выйди она замуж за Артура, с ним ничего не случилось бы. Я говорил без тени гнева, просто был
убит горем. Вероятно, так не нужно было говорить. В записке она немекает на эти слова.
«Дорогой дядя!
Я знаю, что причинила вам много горя и что поступи я иначе, не произошло бы это
ужасное несчастье. С этой мыслью я не смогу быть счастливой под вашей крышей и покидаю вас навсегда. Не беспокойтесь о моем будущем и, самое главное, не ищите меня,
потому что это бесцельно и может только повредить мне.
Всю жизнь до самой смерти любящая вас Мэри».
– Что означает эта записка, мистер Холмс? Уж не хочет ли она покончить самоубийством?
– О нет, ничего подобного. Может быть, это наилучшим образом решает все проблемы. Я уверен, мистер Холдер, что ваши испытания близятся к концу.
– Да, вы так думаете? Вы узнали что-нибудь новое, мистер Холмс? Узнали, где бериллы?
– Тысячу фунтов за каждый камень вы не сочтете чересчур высокой платой?
– Я заплатил бы все десять!
– В этом нет необходимости. Трех тысяч вполне достаточно, если не считать некоторого вознаграждения мне. Чековая книжка при вас? Вот перо. Выпишите чек на четыре тысячи фунтов.
Банкир в изумлении подписал чек. Холмс подошел к письменному столу, достал маленький
треугольный кусок золота с тремя бериллами и положил на стол. Мистер Холдер с радостным криком схватил свое сокровище.
– Я спасен, спасен! – повторял он, задыхаясь. – Вы нашли их!
Радость его была столь же бурной, как и вчерашнее отчаяние. Он крепко прижимал к груди
найденное сокровище.
– За вами еще один долг, мистер Холдер, – сказал Холмс сурово.
– Долг? – Банкир схватил перо. – Назовите сумму, и я выплачу вам ее немедленно.
– Нет, не мне. Вы должны попросить прощения у вашего сына. Он держал себя мужественно и
благородно. Имей я такого сына, я гордился бы им.
– Значит, не Артур взял камни?
– Да, не он. Я говорил это вчера и повторяю сегодня.
– В таком случае поспешим к нему и сообщим, что правда восторжествовала.
– Он все знает. Я беседовал с ним, когда распутал дело. Поняв, что он не хочет говорить, я сам
изложил ему всю историю, и он признал, что я прав, и, в свою очередь, рассказал о некоторых подробностях, которые были неясны мне. Новость, которую вы нам только что сообщили, возможно, заставит его быть вполне откровенным.
– Так раскройте же, ради Бога, эту невероятную тайну!
– Сейчас я расскажу, каким путем мне удалось добраться до истины. Но сначала разрешите сообщить вам тяжелую весть: ваша племянница Мэри была в сговоре с сэром Джорджем Бэрнвеллом.
Сейчас они оба скрылись.
– Мэри? Это невозможно!
– К сожалению, это факт! Принимая в своем доме сэра Джорджа Бэрнвелла, ни вы, ни ваш сын
не знали его как следует. А между тем он один из опаснейших субъектов, игрок, отъявленный негодяй, человек без сердца и совести. Ваша племянница и понятия не имела, что бывают такие люди.
Слушая его признания и клятвы, она думала, что завоевала его любовь. А он говорил то же самое
многим до нее. Одному дьяволу известно, как он сумел поработить волю Мэри, но так или иначе она
сделалась послушным орудием в его руках. Они виделись почти каждый вечер.
– Я не верю, не могу этому верить! – вскричал банкир. Его лицо стало пепельно-серым.
– А теперь я расскажу, что произошло в вашем доме вчера ночью. Когда ваша племянница убедилась, что вы ушли к себе, она спустилась вниз и, приоткрыв окно над дорожкой, которая ведет в
конюшню, сообщила своему возлюбленному о диадеме. Следы сэра Джорджа ясно отпечатались на
снегу под окном. Жажда наживы охватила сэра Джорджа, он буквально подчинил Мэри своей воле. Я
не сомневаюсь, что Мэри любит вас, но есть категория женщин, у которых любовь к мужчине преодолевает все другие чувства. Мэри из их числа. Едва она успела договориться с ним о похищении
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
драгоценности, как услышала, что вы спускаетесь по лестнице. Тогда, быстро закрыв окно, она сказала вам, что к горничной приходил ее зеленщик. И он в самом деле приходил…
В ту ночь Артуру не спалось: его тревожили клубные долги. Вдруг он услышал, как мимо его
комнаты прошуршали осторожные шаги. Он встал, выглянул за дверь и с изумлением увидел двоюродную сестру – та крадучись пробиралась по коридору и исчезла в вашей комнате. Ошеломленный
Артур наскоро оделся и стал ждать, что произойдет дальше. Скоро Мэри вышла; при свете лампы в
коридоре ваш сын заметил у нее в руках драгоценную диадему. Мэри спустилась вниз по лестнице.
Трепеща от ужаса, Артур проскользнул за портьеру около вашей двери: оттуда видно все, что происходит в гостиной. Мэри потихоньку открыла окно, передала кому-то в темноте диадему, а затем, закрыв окно, поспешила в свою комнату, пройдя совсем близко от Артура, застывшего за портьерой.
Боясь разоблачить любимую девушку, Артур ничего не мог предпринять, хотя понимал, каким
ударом будет для вас пропажа диадемы и как важно вернуть драгоценность. Но едва Мэри скрылась
за дверью своей комнаты, он бросился вниз полуодетый и босой, распахнул окно, выскочил в сад и
помчался по дорожке; там, вдали, виднелся при свете луны чей-то темный силуэт.
Сэр Джордж Бэрнвелл попытался бежать, но Артур догнал его. Между ними завязалась борьба.
Ваш сын тянул диадему за один конец, его противник – за другой. Ваш сын ударил сэра Джорджа и
повредил ему бровь. Затем что-то неожиданно хрустнуло, и Артур почувствовал, что диадема у него
в руках; он кинулся назад, закрыл окно и поднялся в вашу комнату. Только тут он заметил, что диадема погнута, и попытался распрямить ее. В это время вошли вы.
Arthur caught him.
– Боже мой! Боже мой! – задыхаясь, повторял банкир.
– Артур был потрясен вашим несправедливым обвинением. Ведь, напротив, вы должны были
бы благодарить его. Он не мог рассказать вам правду, не предав Мэри, хотя она и не заслуживала
снисхождения. Он вел себя как рыцарь и сохранил тайну.
– Так вот почему она упала в обморок, когда увидела диадему! – воскликнул мистер Холдер. –
Бог мой, какой же я безумец! Ведь Артур просил отпустить его хотя бы на пять минут! Бедный мальчик думал отыскать отломанный кусок диадемы на месте схватки. Как я ошибался!
– Приехав к вам, – продолжал Холмс, – я в первую очередь внимательно осмотрел участок возле дома, надеясь что-нибудь обнаружить. Снега со вчерашнего вечера не выпадало, а сильный мороз
должен был хорошо сохранить следы на снегу. Я прошел по дорожке, которой подвозят продукты, но
она была утоптана. Но неподалеку от двери в кухню я заметил следы женских ботинок; рядом с
женщиной стоял мужчина. Круглые отпечатки показывали, что одна нога у него деревянная. Повидимому, кто-то помешал их разговору, так как женщина побежала к двери: носки женских ботинок
отпечатались глубже, чем каблуки. Человек с деревянной ногой подождал немного, а затем ушел. Я
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
тут же подумал, что это должно быть, горничная и ее поклонник, о которых вы говорили. Так оно, и
оказалось. Я обошел сад, но больше ничего не заметил, кроме беспорядочных следов, разбегавшихся
во всех направлениях. Это ходили полицейские. Но когда я дошел до дорожки, которая вела к конюшне, вся сложная история этой ночи открылась мне, будто написанная на снегу.
Я увидел две линии следов: одна из них принадлежала человеку в ботинках, другая, как я с
удовлетворением заметил, – человеку, бежавшему босиком. Я был уверен, что эта вторая линия –
следы вашего сына. Впоследствии ваши слова подтвердили правильность моего предположения.
Первый человек спокойно шагал туда и обратно, второй бежал. Следы бежавшего отпечатались
там же, где шел человек в ботинках. Из этого можно было сделать вывод, что второй человек преследовал первого. Я пошел по следам человека в ботинках. Они привели меня к окну вашей гостиной;
здесь снег был весь истоптан, очевидно, этот человек кого-то долго поджидал. Тогда я направился по
его следам в противоположную сторону. Они тянулись по дорожке примерно на сотню ярдов. Потом
человек в ботинках обернулся – в этом месте снег был сильно истоптан, словно шла борьба. Капли
крови на снегу свидетельствовали о том, что это так и было. Затем человек в ботинках бросился бежать. На некотором расстоянии я снова заметил кровь; значит, ранен был именно он. Я пошел по
тропинке до самой дороги; там снег был счищен и следы обрывались.
Вы помните, что, войдя в дом, я осмотрел через лупу подоконник и раму окна гостиной и обнаружил, что кто-то вылезал из окна. Я заметил также очертание следа мокрой ноги, то есть человек
залезал и обратно. После этого я уже был в состоянии представить себе все, что произошло. Кто-то
стоял под окном, и кто-то подал ему диадему. Ваш сын видел это, бросился преследовать неизвестного, вступил с ним в борьбу. Каждый из них тянул сокровище к себе. Тогда-то и был отломан кусок
диадемы. Артур поспешил с диадемой домой, не заметив, что у противника остался обломок. Пока
все понятно. Но возникал вопрос: кто этот человек, боровшийся с вашим сыном, и кто подал ему
диадему?
Мой старый принцип расследования состоит в том, чтобы исключить все явно невозможные
предположения. Тогда то, что остается, является истиной, какой бы неправдоподобной она ни казалась.
Рассуждал я примерно так: естественно, не вы отдали диадему. Значит, оставались только ваша
племянница или горничные. Но если в похищении замешаны горничные, то ради чего ваш сын согласился принять вину на себя? Для такого предположения нет оснований. Вы говорили, что Артур любит свою двоюродную сестру. И мне стала понятна причина его молчания: он не хотел выдавать Мэри. Тогда я вспомнил, что вы застали ее у окна и что она упала в обморок, увидав диадему в руках
Артура. Мои предположения превратились в уверенность.
Но кто ее сообщник? Разумеется, это мог быть только ее возлюбленный. Лишь под его влиянием она могла так легко забыть, чем обязана вам. Я знал, что вы редко бываете в обществе и круг ваших знакомых ограничен. Но в их числе сэр Джордж Бэрнвелл. Я и прежде слышал о нем как о человеке крайне легкомысленном по отношению к женщинам. Очевидно, это он стоял под окном и
только у него должны находиться пропавшие бериллы. Артур узнал его, и все же сэр Джордж считал
себя в безопасности, ибо был уверен, что ваш сын не скажет ни слова, чтобы не скомпрометировать
свою собственную семью.
Ну, а теперь элементарная логика подскажет вам, что я предпринял. Переодевшись бродягой, я
отправился к сэру Джорджу. Мне удалось познакомиться с его лакеем, который сообщил, что его хозяин накануне где-то расшиб до крови голову. Мне удалось раздобыть у него за шесть шиллингов
старые ботинки сэра Джорджа, с которыми я отправился в Стритем и убедился, что ботинки точно
соответствуют следам на снегу.
– Вчера вечером я видел какого-то бродягу на тропинке, – сказал мистер Холдер.
– Совершенно верно, это был я. Я понял, что сэр Джордж в моих руках. Нужен был большой
такт, чтобы успешно завершить дело и избежать огласки. Этот хитрый негодяй понимал, как связаны
у нас руки.
Вернувшись домой, я переоделся и отправился к сэру Джорджу. Вначале он, разумеется, все
отрицал, но когда я рассказал в подробностях, что произошло той ночью, он стал угрожать мне и даже схватил висевшую на стене трость. Я знал, с кем имею дело, и мигом приставил револьвер к его
виску. Тогда он образумился. Я объявил ему, что мы согласны выкупить камни по тысяче фунтов за
каждый. Тогда-то он впервые обнаружил признаки огорчения.
– Черт побери! Я уже отдал все три камня за шестьсот фунтов! – воскликнул он.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«I clapped a pistol to his head.»
Пообещав сэру Джорджу, что против него не будет возбуждено судебное расследование, я узнал адрес скупщика, поехал туда и после долгого торга выкупил у него камни по тысяче фунтов каждый. Затем я отправился к вашему сыну, объяснил ему, что все в порядке, и к двум часам ночи после
тяжкого трудового дня добрался домой.
– Благодаря вам в Англии не разразился огромный скандал, – сказал банкир, поднимаясь с
кресла. – Сэр, у меня нет слов, чтобы выразить свою признательность. Но вы убедитесь, что я не забуду того, что вы сделали для меня. Ваше искусство превосходит всякую фантазию. А сейчас я поспешу к моему дорогому мальчику и буду просить у него прощения за то, что так с ним обошелся.
Что же касается бедняжки Мэри, то ее поступок глубоко поразил меня. Боюсь, что даже вы с вашим
богатым опытом не сможете разыскать ее.
– Можно с уверенностью сказать, – возразил Холмс, – что она сейчас там же, где сэр Джордж
Бэрнвелл. Несомненно также и то, что, как бы ни расценивать поступок вашей племянницы, она будет скоро наказана.

– Человек, который любит искусство ради искусства, – заговорил Шерлок Холмс, отбрасывая в
сторону страницу с объявлениями из «Дейли телеграф», – самое большое удовольствие зачастую
черпает из наименее значительных и ярких его проявлений. Отрадно заметить, что вы, Уотсон, хорошо усвоили эту истину при изложении наших скромных подвигов, которые по доброте своей вы
решились увековечить и, вынужден констатировать, порой пытаетесь приукрашивать, уделяете внимание не столько громким делам и сенсационным процессам, в коих я имел честь принимать участие,
сколько случаям самим по себе незначительным, но зато предоставляющим большие возможности
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
для дедуктивных методов мышления и логического синтеза, что особенно меня интересует.
Talking up a glowing cinder with the tongs.
– Тем не менее, – улыбнулся я, – не смею утверждать, что в моих записках вовсе отсутствует
стремление к сенсационности.
– Возможно, вы и ошибаетесь, – продолжал он, подхватив щипцами тлеющий уголек и раскуривая длинную трубку вишневого дерева, которая заменяла глиняную в те дни, когда он был настроен скорее спорить, нежели размышлять, – возможно, вы и ошибаетесь, стараясь приукрасить и оживить ваши записки вместо того, чтобы ограничиться сухим анализом причин и следствий, который
единственно может вызывать интерес в том или ином деле.
– Мне кажется, в своих записках я отдаю вам должное, – несколько холодно возразил я, ибо
меня раздражало самомнение моего друга, которое, как я неоднократно убеждался, было весьма приметной чертой в его своеобразном характере.
– Нет, это не эгоизм и не тщеславие, – сказал он, отвечая по привычке скорее моим мыслям,
чем моим словам. – Если я прошу отдать должное моему искусству, то это не имеет никакого отношения ко мне лично, оно – вне меня. Преступление – вещь повседневная. Логика – редкая. Именно на
логике, а не преступлении вам и следовало бы сосредоточиться. А у вас курс серьезных лекций превратился в сборник занимательных рассказов.
Было холодное утро начала весны; покончив с завтраком, мы сидели возле ярко пылавшего камина в нашей квартире на Бейкер-стрит. Густой туман повис между рядами сумрачных домов, и
лишь окна напротив тусклыми, расплывшимися пятнами маячили в темно-желтой мгле. У нас горел
свет, и блики его играли на белой скатерти и на посуде – со стола еще не убирали. Все утро Шерлок
Холмс молчал, сосредоточенно просматривая газетные объявления, пока наконец, по-видимому, отказавшись от поисков и пребывая не в лучшем из настроений, не принялся читать мне нравоучения
по поводу моих литературных занятий.
– В то же время, – после паузы продолжал он, попыхивая своей длинной трубкой и задумчиво
глядя в огонь, – вас вряд ли можно обвинить в стремлении к сенсационности, ибо большинство тех
случаев, к которым вы столь любезно проявили интерес, вовсе не представляет собой преступления.
Незначительное происшествие с королем Богемии, когда я пытался оказать ему помощь, странный
случай с Мэри Сазерлэнд, история человека с рассеченной губой и случай со знатными холостяком –
все это не может стать предметом судебного разбирательства. Боюсь, однако, что, избегая сенсационности, вы оказались в плену тривиальности.
– Может, в конце концов так и случилось, – ответил я, – но методы, о которых я рассказываю,
своеобразны и не лишены новизны.
– Мой дорогой, какое дело публике, великой, но лишенной наблюдательности публике, едва ли
способной по зубам узнать ткача или по большому пальцу левой руки – наборщика, до тончайших
оттенков анализа и дедукции? И тем не менее, даже если вы банальны, я вас не виню, ибо дни великих дел сочтены. Человек, или по крайней мере преступник, утратил предприимчивость и самобытность. Что же касается моей скромной практики, то я, похоже, превращаюсь в агента по розыску уте-

рянных карандашей и наставника молодых леди из пансиона для благородных девиц. Наконец-то я
разобрался, на что гожусь. А полученное мною утром письмо означает, что мне пора приступить к
новой деятельности. Прочтите его. – И он протянул мне помятый листок.
Письмо было отправлено из Монтегю-плейс накануне вечером.
«Дорогой мистер Холмс!
Мне очень хочется посоветоваться с вами по поводу предложения занять место гувернантки. Если разрешите, я зайду к вам завтра в половине одиннадцатого.
С уважением Вайолет Хантер».
– Вы знаете эту молодую леди? – спросил я.
– Нет.
– Сейчас половина одиннадцатого.
– Да, а вот, не сомневаюсь, она звонит.
– Это дело может оказаться более интересным, нежели вы предполагаете. Вспомните случай с
голубым карбункулом, который сначала вы сочли просто недоразумением, а потом он потребовал
серьезного расследования. Так может получиться и на этот раз.
– Что ж, будем надеяться! Наши сомнения очень скоро рассеются, ибо вот и особа, о которой
идет речь.
Дверь отворилась, и в комнату вошла молодая женщина. Она была просто, но аккуратно одета,
лицо у нее было смышленое, живое, все в веснушках, как яичко ржанки, а энергичность, которая чувствовалась в ее движениях, свидетельствовала о том, что ей самой приходится пробивать себе дорогу
в жизни.
– Ради Бога извините за беспокойство, – сказала она, когда мой друг поднялся ей навстречу, –
но со мной произошло нечто настолько необычное, что я решила просить у вас совета. У меня нет ни
родителей, ни родственников, к которым я могла бы обратиться.
– Прошу садиться, мисс Хантер. Буду счастлив помочь вам, чем могу.
Я понял, что речь и манеры клиентки произвели на Холмса благоприятное впечатление: Он испытующе оглядел ее с ног до головы, а затем, прикрыв глаза и сложив вместе кончики пальцев, приготовился слушать.
«Capital!»
– В течение пяти лет я была гувернанткой в семье полковника Спенса Манроу, но два месяца
назад полковник получил назначение в Канаду и забрал с собой в Галифакс и детей. Я осталась без
работы. Я давала объявления, сама ходила по объявлениям, но все безуспешно. Наконец та небольшая сумма денег, что мне удалось скопить, начала иссякать, и я просто ума не приложу, что делать.
В Вест-Энде есть агентство по найму «Вестэуэй» – его все знают, – и я взяла за правило заходить туда раз в неделю в поисках чего-либо подходящего. Вестэуэй – фамилия владельца этого
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
агентства, в действительности же все дела вершит некая мисс Стопер. Она сидит у себя в кабинете,
женщины, которые ищут работу, ожидают в приемной; их поочередно вызывают в кабинет, и она заглядывая в свой гроссбух, предлагает им те или иные вакансии.
По обыкновению и меня пригласили в кабинет, когда я зашла туда на прошлой неделе, но на
этот раз мисс Стопер была не одна. Рядом с ней сидел толстый, претолстый человек с улыбчивым
лицом и большим подбородком, тяжелыми складками спускавшимся на грудь, и сквозь очки внимательно разглядывал просительниц. Стоило лишь мне войти, как он подскочил на месте и обернулся к
мисс Стопер.
– Подходит, – воскликнул он. – Лучшего и желать нельзя. Грандиозно! Грандиозно!
Он, по-видимому, был в восторге и от удовольствия потирал руки. На него приятно было смотреть: таким добродушным он казался.
– Ищете место, мисс? – спросил он.
– Да, сэр.
– Гувернантки?
– Да, сэр.
– А сколько вы хотите получать?
– Полковник Спенс Манроу, у которого я служила, платил мне четыре фунта в месяц.
– Вот это да! Самая что ни на есть настоящая эксплуатация! – вскричал он, яростно размахивая
пухлыми кулаками. – Разве можно предлагать столь ничтожную сумму леди, наделенной такой
внешностью и такими достоинствами?
– Мои достоинства, сэр, могут оказаться менее привлекательными, нежели вы полагаете, – сказала я. – Немного французский, немного немецкий, музыка и рисование…
– Вот это да! – снова вскричал он. – Значит и говорить не о чем. Кратко, в двух словах, вопрос
вот в чем: обладаете ли вы манерами настоящей леди? Если нет, то вы нам не подходите, ибо речь
идет о воспитании ребенка, который в один прекрасный день может сыграть значительную роль в
истории Англии. Если да, то разве имеет джентльмен право предложить вам сумму, выраженную менее, чем трехзначной цифрой? У меня, сударыня, вы будете получать для начала сто фунтов в год.
Вы, конечно, представляете, мистер Холмс, что подобное предложение показалось мне просто
невероятным – я ведь осталась совсем без средств. Однако джентльмен, прочитав недоверие на моем
лице, вынул бумажник и достал оттуда деньги.
– В моих обычаях также ссужать юным леди половину жалованья вперед, – сказал он, улыбаясь
на самый приятный манер, так что глаза его превратились в две сияющие щелочки среди белых складок лица, – дабы они могли оплатить мелкие расходы во время путешествия и приобрести нужный
гардероб.
«Никогда еще я не встречала более очаровательного и внимательного человека», – подумалось
мне. Ведь у меня уже появились кое-какие долги, аванс был очень кстати, и все-таки было что-то
странное в этом деле, и, прежде чем дать согласие, я попыталась разузнать об этом человеке побольше.
– А где вы живете, сэр? – спросила я.
– В Хемпшире. Чудная сельская местность. «Медные буки», в пяти милях от Уинчестера. Место прекрасное, моя дорогая юная леди, и дом восхитительный – старинный загородный дом.
– А мои обязанности, сэр? Хотелось бы знать, в чем они состоят.
– Один ребенок, очаровательный маленький проказник, ему только что исполнилось шесть лет.
Если бы вы видели, как он бьет комнатной туфлей тараканов! Шлеп! Шлеп! Шлеп! Не успеешь и
глазом моргнуть, а трех как не бывало.
Расхохотавшись, он откинулся на спинку стула, и глаза его снова превратились в щелочки.
Меня несколько удивил характер детских забав, но отец смеялся – я решила, что он шутит.
– Значит, мои обязанности – присматривать за ребенком? – спросила я.
– Нет-нет, не только присматривать, не только, моя дорогая юная леди! – вскричал он. – Вам
придется также – я уверен, вы и протестовать не будете, – выполнять кое-какие поручения моей жены при условии, разумеется, если эти поручения не будут унижать вашего достоинства. Немного, не
правда ли?
– Буду рада оказаться вам полезной.
– Вот именно. Ну, например, речь пойдет о платье. Мы, знаете ли, люди чудаковатые, но сердце
у нас доброе. Если мы попросим вас надеть платье, которое мы дадим, вы ведь не будете возражать
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
против нашей маленькой прихоти, а?
– Нет, – ответила я в крайнем удивлении.
– Или сесть там, где нам захочется? Это ведь не покажется вам обидным?
– Да нет…
– Или остричь волосы перед приездом к нам?
Я едва поверила своим ушам. Вы видите, мистер Холмс, у меня густые волосы с особым каштановым отливом. Их считают красивыми. Зачем мне ни с того ни с сего жертвовать ими?
– Нет, это невозможно, – ответила я.
Он жадно глядел на меня своими глазками, и я заметила, что лицо у него помрачнело.
– Но это – обязательное условие, – сказал он. – Маленькая прихоть моей жены, а дамским капризам, как вам известно, сударыня, следует потакать. Значит, вам не угодно остричь волосы?
– Нет, сэр, не могу, – твердо ответила я.
– Что ж… Значит вопрос решен. Жаль, жаль, во всех остальных отношениях вы нам вполне
подходите. Мисс Стопер, в таком случае мне придется познакомиться с другими юными леди.
Заведующая агентством все это время сидела, просматривая свои бумаги и не проронив ни слова, но теперь она глянула на меня с таким раздражением, что я поняла: из-за меня она потеряла немалое комиссионное вознаграждение.
– Вы хотите остаться в наши списках? – спросила она.
– Если можно, мисс Стопер.
– Мне это представляется бесполезным, поскольку вы отказались от очень интересного предложения, – резко заметила она. – Не будем же мы из кожи лезть вон, чтобы подобрать для вас такое
место. Всего хорошего, мисс Хантер.
Она позвонила в колокольчик, и мальчик проводил меня обратно в приемную.
Вернувшись домой – в буфете у меня было пусто, а на столе – лишь новые счета, – я спросила
себя, не поступила ли я неосмотрительно. Что из того, что у этих людей есть какие-то причуды и они
хотят, чтобы исполнялись самые неожиданные их капризы? Они ведь готовы платить за это. Много
ли в Англии гувернанток, получающих сотню в год? Кроме того, какой прок от моих волос? Некоторым даже идет короткая стрижка, может, пойдет и мне? На следующий день я подумала, что совершила ошибку, а еще через день перестала в этом сомневаться. Я уже собиралась, подавив чувство
гордости, пойти снова в агентство, чтобы узнать, не занято ли еще это место, как вдруг получаю
письмо от этого самого джентльмена. Вот оно, мистер Холмс, я прочту его.
«Медные буки», близ Винчестера.
Дорогая мисс Хантер!
Мисс Стопер любезно согласилась дать мне ваш адрес, и я пишу вам из дома, желая
осведомиться, не переменили ли вы свое решение. Моя жена очень хочет, чтобы вы приехали к нам, – я описал ей вас, и вы ей страшно понравились. Мы готовы платить вам десять фунтов в месяц, то есть сто двадцать в год в качестве компенсации за те неудобства,
которые могут причинить наши требования. Да они не так уж и суровы. Моя жена очень
любит цвет электрик, и ей хотелось бы, чтобы вы надевали платье такого цвета по утрам.
Вам совершенно незачем тратиться на подобную вещь, поскольку у нас есть платье моей
дорогой дочери Алисы (ныне пребывающей в Филадельфии), думаю, оно будет вам впору. Полагаю, что и просьбу занять определенное место в комнате или выполнить какоелибо иное поручение вы не сочтете чересчур обременительной. Что же касается ваших
волос, то их действительно очень жаль: даже во время нашей краткой беседы я успел заметить, как они хороши, но тем не менее я вынужден настаивать на этом условии. Надеюсь, что прибавка к жалованью вознаградит вас за эту жертву. Обязанности в отношении
ребенка весьма несложны. Пожалуйста, приезжайте, я встречу вас в Винчестере. Сообщите каким поездом вы прибудете.
Искренне ваш Джефро Рукасл».
Вот какое письмо я получила, мистер Холмс, и твердо решила принять предложение. Однако,
прежде чем сделать окончательный шаг, мне хотелось бы услышать ваше мнение.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Что ж, мисс Хантер, коли вы решились, значит, дело сделано, – улыбнулся Холмс.
– А вы не советуете?
– Признаюсь, место это не из тех, что я пожелал бы для своей сестры.
– А что все-таки под этим кроется, мистер Холмс?
– Не знаю. Может, у вас есть какие-либо соображения?
– Я думаю, что мистер Рукасл – добрый, мягкосердечный человек. А его жена, наверное, немного сумасшедшая. Вот он и старается держать это в тайне, опасаясь, как бы ее не забрали в дом
для умалишенных, и потворствует ее причудам, чтобы с ней не случился припадок.
– Может быть, может быть. На сегодняшний день это самое вероятное предположение. Тем не
менее место это вовсе не для молодой леди.
– Но деньги, мистер Холмс, деньги!
– Да, конечно, жалованье хорошее, даже слишком хорошее. Вот это меня и тревожит. Почему
они дают сто двадцать фунтов, когда легко найти человека и за сорок? Значит, есть какая-то веская
причина.
– Вот я и подумала, что, если расскажу вам все обстоятельства дела, вы позволите мне в случае
необходимости обратиться к вам за помощью. Я буду чувствовать себя гораздо спокойнее, зная, что у
меня есть заступник.
– Можете вполне на меня рассчитывать. Уверяю вас, ваша маленькая проблема обещает оказаться наиболее интересной за последние месяцы. В деталях определенно есть нечто оригинальное.
Если у вас появятся какие-либо подозрения или возникнет опасность…
– Опасность? Какая опасность?
– Если бы опасность можно было предвидеть, то ее не нужно было бы страшиться, – с самым
серьезным видом пояснил Холмс.
– Во всяком случае, в любое время дня и ночи шлите телеграмму, и я приду вам на помощь.
– Тогда все в порядке. – Выражение озабоченности исчезло с ее лица, она проворно поднялась. – Сейчас же напишу мистеру Рукаслу, вечером остригу мои бедные волосы и завтра отправлюсь в Винчестер.
Скупо поблагодарив Холмса и попрощавшись, она поспешно ушла.
Holmes shook his head gravely.
– Во всяком случае, – сказал я, прислушиваясь к ее быстрым, твердым шагам на лестнице, – она
производит впечатление человека, умеющего за себя постоять.
– Ей придется это сделать, – мрачно заметил Холмс. – Не сомневаюсь, через несколько дней мы
получим от нее известие.
Предсказание моего друга, как всегда, сбылось. Прошла неделя, в течение которой я неоднократно возвращался мыслями к нашей посетительнице, задумываясь над тем, в какие дебри человеческих отношений может завести жизнь эту одинокую женщину. Большое жалованье, странные условия, легкие обязанности – во всем этом было что-то неестественное, хотя я абсолютно был не в
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
состоянии решить, причуда это или какой-то замысел, филантроп этот человек или негодяй. Что касается Холмса, то он подолгу сидел, нахмурив лоб и рассеянно глядя вдаль, но когда я принимался
его расспрашивать, он лишь махал в ответ рукой.
– Ничего не знаю, ничего! – раздраженно восклицал он. – Когда под рукой нет глины, из чего
лепить кирпичи?
Телеграмма, которую мы получили, прибыла поздно вечером, когда я уже собирался лечь
спать, а Холмс приступил к опытам, за которыми частенько проводил ночи напролет. Когда я уходил
к себе, он стоял, наклонившись над ретортой и пробирками; утром, спустившись к завтраку, я застал
его в том же положении. Он открыл желтый конверт и, пробежав взглядом листок, передал его мне.
– Посмотрите расписание поездов, – сказал он и повернулся к своим колбам.
Текст телеграммы был кратким и настойчивым:
«Прошу быть гостинице „Черный лебедь“ Винчестере завтра полдень. Приезжайте!
Не знаю, что делать. Хантер».
– Поедете со мной? – спросил Холмс, на секунду отрываясь от своих колб.
– С удовольствием.
– Тогда посмотрите расписание.
– Есть поезд в половине десятого, – сказал я, изучая справочник. – Он прибывает в Винчестер в
одиннадцать тридцать.
– Прекрасно. Тогда, пожалуй, я отложу анализ ацетона, завтра утром нам может понадобиться
максимум энергии.
В одиннадцать утра на следующий день мы уже были на пути к древней столице Англии.
Холмс всю дорогу не отрывался от газет, но после того как мы переехали границу Хампшира, он отбросил их принялся смотреть в окно. Стоял прекрасный весенний день, бледно-голубое небо было
испещрено маленькими кудрявыми облаками, которые плыли с запада на восток. Солнце светило ярко, и в воздухе царило веселье и бодрость. На протяжении всего пути, вплоть до холмов Олдершота,
среди яркой весенней листвы проглядывали красные и серые крыши ферм.
– До чего приятно на них смотреть! – воскликнул я с энтузиазмом человека, вырвавшегося из
туманов Бейкер-стрит.
Но Холмс мрачно покачал головой.
– Знаете, Уотсон, – сказал он, – беда такого мышления, как у меня, в том, что я воспринимаю
окружающее очень субъективно. Вот вы смотрите на эти рассеянные вдоль дороги дома и восхищаетесь их красотой. А я, когда вижу их, думаю только о том, как они уединенны и как безнаказанно
здесь можно совершить преступление.
– О Господи! – воскликнул я. – Кому бы в голову пришло связывать эти милые сердцу старые
домики с преступлением?
– Они внушают мне страх. Я уверен, Уотсон, – и уверенность эта проистекает из опыта, – что в
самых отвратительных трущобах Лондона не свершается столько страшных грехов, сколько в этой
восхитительной и веселой сельской местности.
– Вас прямо страшно слушать.
– И причина этому совершенно очевидна. То, чего не в состоянии совершить закон, в городе
делает общественное мнение. В самой жалкой трущобе крик ребенка, которого бьют, или драка, которую затеял пьяница, тотчас же вызовет участие или гнев соседей, и правосудие близко, так что
единое слово жалобы приводит его механизм в движение. Значит, от преступления до скамьи подсудимых – всего один шаг, А теперь взгляните на эти уединенные дома – каждый из них отстоит от соседнего на добрую милю, они населены в большинстве своем невежественным бедняками, которые
мало что смыслят в законодательстве. Представьте, какие дьявольски жестокие помыслы и безнравственность тайком процветают здесь из года в год. Если бы эта дама, что обратилась к нам за помощью, поселилась в Винчестере, я не боялся бы за нее. Расстояние в пять миль от города – вот где
опасность! И все-таки ясно, что опасность угрожает не ей лично.
– Понятно. Если она может приехать в Винчестер встретить нас, значит, она в состоянии вообще уехать.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Совершенно справедливо. Ее свобода передвижения не ограничена.
– В чем же тогда дело? Вы нашли какое-нибудь объяснение?
– Я придумал семь разных версий, и каждая из них опирается на известные нам факты. Но какая из них правильная, покажут новые сведения, которые, не сомневаюсь, нас ждут. А вот и купол
собора, скоро мы узнаем, что же хочет сообщить нам мисс Хантер.
«Черный лебедь» оказался уважаемой в городе гостиницей на Хайд-стрит, совсем близко от
станции, там мы и нашли молодую женщину. Она сидела в гостиной, на столе нас ждал завтрак.
– Я рада, что вы приехали, – серьезно сказала она. – Большое спасибо. Я в самом деле не знаю,
что делать. Мне страшно нужен ваш совет.
– Расскажите же, что случилось.
– Сейчас расскажу, я должна спешить, потому что обещала мистеру Рукаслу вернуться к трем.
Он разрешил мне съездить в город нынче утром, хотя ему, конечно, неведомо зачем.
– Изложите все по порядку. – Холмс вытянул свои длинные ноги в сторону камина и приготовился слушать.
«I am so delighted that you have come.»
Прежде всего должна сказать, что, в общем, мистер и миссис Рукасл встретили меня довольно
приветливо. Ради справедливости об этом следует упомянуть. Но понять их я не могу, и это не дает
мне покоя.
– Что именно?
– Их поведение. Однако все по порядку. Когда я приехала, мистер Рукасл встретил меня на
станции и повез в своем экипаже в «Медные буки». Поместье, как он и говорил, чудесно расположено, но вовсе не отличается красотой: большой квадратный дом, побеленный известкой, весь в пятнах
и подтеках от дождя и сырости. С трех сторон его окружает лес, а с фасада – луг, который опускается
к дороге на Саутгемптон, что проходит примерно ярдах в ста от парадного крыльца. Участок перед
домом принадлежит мистеру Рукаслу, а леса вокруг – собственность лорда Саутертона. Прямо перед
домом растет несколько медных буков, отсюда и название усадьбы.
Мой хозяин, сама любезность, встретил меня на станции и в тот же вечер познакомил со своей
женой и сыном. Наша с вами догадка, мистер Холмс, оказалась неверной: миссис Рукасл не сумасшедшая. Молчаливая бледная женщина, она намного моложе своего мужа, на вид ей не больше тридцати, в то время как ему дашь все сорок пять. Из разговоров я поняла, что они женаты лет семь, что
он остался вдовцом и что от первой жены у него одна дочь – та самая, которая в Филадельфии. Мистер Рукасл по секрету сообщил мне, что уехала она из-за того, что испытывала какую-то непонятную
антипатию к мачехе. Поскольку дочери никак не менее двадцати лет, то я вполне представляю, как
неловко она чувствовала себя рядом с молодой женой отца.
Миссис Рукасл показалась мне внутренне столь же бесцветным существом, сколь и внешне.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Она не произвела на меня никакого впечатления. Пустое место. И сразу заметна ее страстная преданность мужу и сыну. Светло-серые глаза постоянно блуждают от одного к другому, подмечая их малейшее желание и по возможности предупреждая его. Мистер Рукасл тоже в присущей ему грубовато-добродушной манере неплохо к ней относится, и в целом они производят впечатление
благополучной пары. Но у женщины есть какая-то тайна. Она часто погружается в глубокую задумчивость, и лицо ее становится печальным. Не раз я заставала ее в слезах. Порой мне кажется, что
причиной этому – ребенок, ибо мне еще ни разу не доводилось видеть такое испорченное и злобное
маленькое существо. Для своего возраста он мал, зато у него несоразмерно большая голова. Он то
подвержен припадкам дикой ярости, то пребывает в состоянии мрачной угрюмости. Причинять боль
любому слабому созданию – вот единственное его развлечение, и он выказывает недюжинный талант
в ловле мышей, птиц и насекомых. Но о нем незачем распространяться, мистер Холмс, он не имеет
отношения к нашей истории.
– Мне нужны все подробности, – сказал Холмс, – представляются они вам относящимися к делу или нет.
– Постараюсь ничего не пропустить. Что мне сразу не понравилось в этом доме, так это внешность и поведение слуг. Их всего двое, муж и жена. Толлер, так зовут слугу, – грубый, неотесанный
человек с серой гривой и седыми бакенбардами, от него постоянно несет спиртным. Я дважды видела
его совершенно пьяным, но мистер Рукасл, по-моему, не обращает на это внимания. Жена Толлера –
высокая сильная женщина с сердитым лицом, она так же молчалива, как миссис Рукасл, но гораздо
менее любезна. Удивительно неприятная пара! К счастью, большую часть времени я провожу в детской и в моей собственной комнате, они расположены рядом.
В первые дни после моего приезда в «Медные буки» все шло спокойно. На третий день сразу
после завтрака миссис Рукасл что-то шепнула своему мужу.
– Мы очень обязаны вам, мисс Хантер, – поворачиваясь ко мне, сказал он, – за снисходительность к нашим капризам, вы ведь даже остригли волосы. Право же, это ничуть не испортило вашу
внешность. А теперь посмотрим, как вам идет цвет электрик. У себя на кровати вы найдете платье, и
мы будем очень благодарны, если вы согласитесь его надеть.
Платье, которое лежало у меня в комнате, весьма своеобразного оттенка синего цвета, сшито
было из хорошей шерсти, но, сразу заметно, уже ношенное. Сидело оно безукоризненно, как будто
его шили специально для меня. Когда я вошла, мистер и миссис Рукасл выразили восхищение, но
мне их восторг показался несколько наигранным. Мы находились в гостиной, которая тянется по
всему фасаду дома, с тремя огромными окнами, доходящими до самого пола. Возле среднего окна
спинкой к нему стоял стул. Меня усадили на этот стул, а мистер Рукасл принялся ходить взад и вперед по комнате и рассказывать смешные истории. Вы представить себе не можете, как комично он
рассказывал, и я хохотала до изнеможения. Миссис Рукасл чувство юмора, очевидно, чуждо, она сидела, сложив на коленях руки, с грустным и озабоченным выражением на лице, так ни разу и не
улыбнувшись. Примерно через час мистер Рукасл вдруг объявил, что пора приступать к повседневным обязанностям и что я могу переодеться и пойти в детскую к маленькому Эдуарду.
Два дня спустя при совершенно таких же обстоятельствах вся эта сцена повторилась. Снова я
должна была переодеться, сесть у окна и хохотать над теми забавными историями, неисчислимым
запасом которых обладал мой хозяин. И рассказчиком он был неподражаемым. Затем он дал мне какой-то роман в желтой обложке и, подвинув мой стул так, чтобы моя тень не падала на страницу, попросил почитать ему вслух. Я читала минут десять, начав где-то в середине главы, а потом он вдруг
перебил меня, не дав закончить фразы, и велел пойти переодеться.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«I read for about ten minutes.»
Вы, конечно, понимаете, мистер Холмс, как меня удивил этот спектакль. Я заметила, что они
настойчиво усаживали меня, чтобы я оказалась спиной к окну, поэтому я решила во что бы то ни стало узнать, что происходит на улице. Сначала это не представлялось возможным, но потом мне пришла в голову счастливая мысль: у меня был осколок ручного зеркальца, и я спрятала его в носовой
платок. В следующий раз, в самый разгар веселья, я приложила носовой платок к глазам и, чуть-чуть
приспособившись, сумела рассмотреть все, что находилось позади. Признаться, я была разочарована.
Там не было ничего.
По крайней мере так было на первый взгляд. Но, присмотревшись, я заметила на Саутгемптонской дороге невысокого бородатого человека в сером костюме. Он смотрел в нашу сторону. Дорога
эта очень оживленная, на ней всегда полно народу. Но этот человек стоял, опершись на ограду, и
пристально вглядывался в дом. Я опустила платок и увидела, что миссис Рукасл испытующе смотрит
на меня. Она ничего не сказала, но, я уверена, поняла, что у меня зеркало и я видела, кто стоит перед
домом. Она тотчас же поднялась.
– Джефри, – сказал она, – на дороге стоит какой-то мужчина и самым непозволительным образом разглядывает мисс Хантер.
– Может быть, ваш знакомый, мисс Хантер? – спросил он.
– Нет. Я никого здесь не знаю.
– Подумайте, какая наглость! Пожалуйста, повернитесь и помашите ему, чтобы он ушел.
– А не лучше ли просто не обращать внимания?
– Нет, нет, не то он все время будет здесь слоняться. Пожалуйста, повернитесь и помашите ему.
Я сделала, как меня просили, и в ту же секунду миссис Рукасл опустила занавеску. Это произошло неделю назад, с тех пор я не сидела у окна, не надевала синего платья и человека на дороге
тоже не видела.
– Прошу вас, продолжайте, – сказал Холмс. – Все это очень интересно.
– Боюсь, мой рассказ довольно бессвязен. Не знаю, много ли общего между всеми этими событиями. Так вот, в первый же день моего приезда в «Медные буки» мистер Рукасл подвел меня к маленькому флигелю позади дома. Когда мы приблизились, я услышала звяканье цепи: внутри находилось какое-то большое животное.
– Загляните-ка сюда, – сказал мистер Рукасл, указывая на щель между досками. – Ну, разве это
не красавец?
Я заглянула и увидела два горящих во тьме глаза и смутное очертание какого-то животного. Я
вздрогнула.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
– Не бойтесь, – засмеялся мой хозяин. – Это мой дог Карло. Я называю его моим, но в действительности только старик Толлер осмеливается подойти к нему, чтобы опустить с цепи на ночь, и да
поможет Бог тому, в кого он вонзит свои клыки. Ни под каким видом не переступайте порога дома
ночью, ибо тогда вам суждено распроститься с жизнью.
Предупредил он меня не зря. На третью ночь я случайно выглянула из окна спальни примерно
часа в два. Стояла прекрасная лунная ночь, и лужайка перед домом вся сверкала серебром. Я стояла,
захваченная мирной красотой пейзажа, как вдруг заметила, что в тени буков кто-то движется. Таинственное существо вышло на лужайку, и я увидела огромного, величиной с теленка, дога рыжеватокоричневой масти, с отвислым подгрудком, черной мордой и могучими мослами. Он медленно пересек лужайку и исчез в темноте на противоположной стороне. При виде этого страшного немого
стража сердце у меня замерло так, как никогда не случалось при появлении грабителя.
А вот еще одно происшествие, о котором мне тоже хочется вам рассказать. Вы знаете, что я
остригла волосы еще до отъезда из Лондона и отрезанную косу спрятала на дно чемодана. Однажды
вечером, уложив мальчика спать, я принялась раскладывать свои вещи. В комнате стоит старый комод, два верхних ящика его открыты, и там ничего не было, но нижний заперт. Я положила свое белье в верхние ящики, места не хватило, и я, естественно, была недовольна тем, что нижний ящик заперт. Я решила, что его заперли по недоразумению, поэтому, достав ключи, я попыталась его
открыть. Подошел первый же ключ, ящик открылся. Там лежала только одна вещь. И как вы думаете,
что именно? Моя коса!
Я взяла ее и как следует рассмотрела. Такой же особый цвет, как у меня, такие же густые волосы. Но затем я сообразила, что это не мои волосы. Как они могли очутиться в запертом ящике комода? Дрожащими руками я раскрыла свой чемодан, выбросила из него вещи и на дне его увидела свою
косу. Я положила две косы рядом, уверяю вас, они были совершенно одинаковыми. Ну, разве это не
удивительно? Я была в полнейшем недоумении. Я положила чужую косу обратно в ящик и ничего не
сказала об этом Рукаслам: я поступила дурно, чувствовала я, открыв запертый ящик.
«I took it up and examined it.»
Вы, мистер Холмс, наверное, заметили, что я наблюдательна, поэтому мне не составило труда
освоиться с расположением комнат и коридоров в доме. Одно крыло его, по-видимому, было нежилым. Дверь, которая вела туда, находилась напротив комнат Толлеров, но была заперта. Однажды,
поднимаясь по лестнице, я увидела, как оттуда с ключами в руках выходил мистер Рукасл. Лицо его в
этот момент было совсем не таким, как всегда. Щеки его горели, лоб морщинился от гнева, а на висках набухли вены. Не взглянув на меня и не сказав ни слова, он запер дверь и поспешил вниз.
Это событие пробудило мое любопытство. Отправившись на прогулку с ребенком, я пошла туда, откуда хорошо видны окна той части дома. Окон было четыре, все они выходили на одну сторону, три просто грязные, а четвертое еще и загорожено ставнями. Там, по-видимому, никто не жил.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
Пока я ходила взад и вперед по саду, ко мне вышел снова веселый и жизнерадостный мистер Рукасл.
– Не сочтите за грубость, моя дорогая юная леди, – обратился ко мне он, – что я прошел мимо
вас, не сказав ни слова привета. Я был очень озабочен своими делами.
Я уверила его, что ничуть не обиделась.
– Между прочим, – сказала я, – у вас наверху, по-видимому, никто не живет, потому что одно
окно даже загорожено ставнями.
– Я увлекаюсь фотографией, – ответил он, – и устроил там темную комнату. Но до чего вы наблюдательны, моя дорогая юная леди! Кто бы мог подумать!
Так вот, мистер Холмс, как только я поняла, что от меня что-то скрывают, я загорелась желанием проникнуть в эти комнаты. Это было не просто любопытство, хоть и оно мне не чуждо. Это было
чувство долга и уверенности, что если я туда проникну, я совершу добрый поступок. Говорят, что у
женщин есть какое-то особое чутье. Быть может, именно оно поддерживало эту уверенность. Во всяком случае, я настойчиво искала возможность проникнуть за запретную дверь.
Возможность эта представилась только вчера. Должна сказать вам, что кроме мистера Рукасла в
пустые комнаты зачем-то входили Толлер и его жена, а один раз я даже видела, как Толлер вынес оттуда большой черный мешок. Последние дни он много пьет и вчера вечером был совсем пьян. Поднявшись наверх, я заметила, что ключ от двери торчит в замке. Мистер и миссис Рукасл находились
внизу, ребенок был с ними, поэтому я решила воспользоваться предоставившейся мне возможностью. Тихо повернув ключ, я отворила дверь и проскользнула внутрь.
Передо мной был небольшой коридор с голыми стенами и пол, не застланный ковром. В конце
коридор сворачивал налево. За углом шли подряд три двери, первая и третья отворены и вели в пустые комнаты, запыленные и мрачные. В первой комнате было два окна, а во второй – одно, такое
грязное, что сквозь него еле-еле проникал вечерний свет. Средняя дверь была закрыта и заложена
снаружи широкой перекладиной от железной кровати; один конец перекладины был продет во вделанное в стену кольцо, а другой привязан толстой веревкой. Ключа в двери не оказалось. Эта забаррикадированная дверь вполне соответствовала закрытому ставнями окну, но по свету, что пробивался из-под нее, я поняла, что в комнате не совсем темно. По-видимому, свет проникал туда из люка,
ведущего на чердак. Я стояла в коридоре, глядя на страшную дверь и раздумывая, что может таиться
за нею, как вдруг услышала внутри шаги и увидела, как на узкую полоску тусклого света, проникающего из-под двери, то надвигалась какая-то тень, то удалялась от нее. Безумный страх охватил
меня, мистер Холмс. Напряженные нервы не выдержали, я повернулась и бросилась бежать – так,
будто сзади меня хватала какая-то страшная рука. Я промчалась по коридору, выбежала на площадку
и очутилась прямо в объятиях мистера Рукасла.
– Значит, – улыбаясь, сказал он, – это были вы. Я так и подумал, когда увидел, что дверь открыта.
– Ох, как я перепугалась! – пролепетала я.
– Моя дорогая юная леди! Что же так напугало вас, моя дорогая юная леди?
Вы и представить себе не можете, как ласково и успокаювающе он это говорил.
Но голос его был чересчур добрым. Он переигрывал. Я снова была начеку.
– По глупости я забрела в нежилое крыло, – объяснила я.
– Но там так пусто и такой мрак, что я испугалась и убежала. Ох, как там страшно!
– И это все? – спросил он, зорко вглядываясь в меня.
– Что же еще? – воскликнула я.
– Как вы думаете, почему я запер эту дверь?
– Откуда же мне знать?
– Чтобы посторонние не совали туда свой нос. Понятно?
Он продолжал улыбаться самой любезной улыбкой.
– Уверяю вас, если бы я знала…
– Что ж, теперь знайте. И если вы хоть раз снова переступите этот порог… – при этих словах
улыбка его превратилась в гневную гримасу, словно дьявол глянул на меня своим свирепым оком, – я
отдам вас на растерзание моему мастифу.
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
«Oh, I am so frightened!» I panted.
Я была так напугана, что не помню, как поступила в ту минуту. Наверное, я метнулась мимо
него в свою комнату. Очнулась я, дрожа всем телом, уже у себя на постели. И тогда я подумала про
вас, мистер Холмс. Я больше не могла там находиться, мне нужно было посоветоваться с вами. Этот
дом, этот человек, его жена, его слуги, даже ребенок – все внушало мне страх. Если бы только вызвать вас сюда, тогда все было бы в порядке. Конечно, я могла бы бежать оттуда, но меня терзало
любопытство, не менее сильное, чем страх. И я решила послать вам телеграмму. Я надела пальто и
шляпу, сходила на почту, что в полу-миле от нас, и затем, испытывая некоторое облегчение, пошла
назад. У самого дома мне пришла в голову мысль, не спустили ли они собаку, но тут же я вспомнила,
что Толлер напился до бесчувствия, а без него никто не сумеет спустить с цепи эту злобную тварь. Я
благополучно проскользнула внутрь и полночи не спала, радуясь, что увижу вас. Сегодня утром я без
труда получила разрешение съездить в Винчестер. Правда, мне нужно вернуться к трем часам, так
как мистер и миссис Рукасл едут к кому-то в гости, поэтому я весь вечер должна быть с ребенком.
Теперь вам известны, мистер Холмс, все мои приключения, и я была бы очень рада, если бы вы объяснили мне, что все это значит, и прежде всего научили, как я должна поступить.
Холмс и я, затаив дыхание, слушали этот удивительный рассказ. Мой друг встал и, засунув руки в карманы, принялся ходить взад и вперед по комнате. Лицо его было чрезвычайно серьезным.
– Толлер все еще пьян? – спросил он.
– Да. Его жена утром говорила миссис Рукасл, что ничего не может с ним сделать.
– Хорошо. Так вы говорите, что Рукаслов нынче весь вечер не будет дома?
– Да.
– В доме есть какой-нибудь погреб, который закрывается на хороший, крепкий замок?
– Да, винный погреб.
– Мисс Хантер, вы вели себя очень отважно и разумно. Сумеете ли вы совершить еще один
смелый поступок? Я бы не обратился с подобной просьбой, если бы не считал вас женщиной незаурядной.
– Попробую. А что я должна сделать?
– Мы, мой друг и я, приедем в «Медные буки» в семь часов. К этому времени Рукаслы уедут, а
Толлер, надеюсь не проспится. Остается мисс Толлер. Если вы сумеете под каким-нибудь предлогом
послать ее в погреб, а потом запереть там, вы облегчите нашу задачу.
– Я это сделаю.
– Прекрасно! Тогда нам удастся поподробнее расследовать эту историю, у которой только одно
Артур Конан Дойл: «Приключения Шерлока Холмса»
объяснение. Вас пригласили туда сыграть роль некоей молодой особы, которую они заточили в комнате наверху. Тут нет никаких сомнений. Кто она? Я уверен, что дочь мистера Рукасла, Алиса, которая, если я не запамятовал, уехала в Америку. Выбор пал на вас, вы похожи на нее ростом, фигурой и
цветом волос. Во время болезни ей, наверное, остригли волосы, поэтому пришлось принести в жертву и ваши. Вы случайно нашли ее косу. Человек на дороге – это ее друг или жених, а так как вы похожи на нее – на вас было ее платье, – то видя, что вы смеетесь и даже машете, чтобы он ушел, он
решил, что мисс Рукасл счастлива и более в нем не нуждается. Собаку спускали по ночам для того,
чтобы помешать его попыткам увидеться с Алисой. Все это совершенно ясно. Самое существенное в
этом деле – это ребенок.
– Он-то какое отношение имеет ко всей этой истории? – воскликнул я.
– Мой дорогой Уотсон, вы врач и должны знать, что поступки ребенка можно понять, изучив
нрав его родителей. И наоборот. Я часто определял характер родителей, изучив нрав их детей. Этот
ребенок аномален в своей жестокости, он наслаждается ею, и унаследовал ли он ее от своего улыбчивого отца или от матери, эта черта одинаково опасна для той девушки, что находится в их власти.
– Вы совершенно правы, мистер Холмс! – вскричала наша клиентка. – Мне приходят на память
тысячи мелочей, которые свидетельствуют о том, как вы правы. О, давайте не будем терять ни минуты, поможем этой бедняжке.
– Надо быть осторожными, потому что мы имеем дело с очень хитрым человеком. До вечера
мы ничего не можем предпринять. В семь мы будем у вас и сумеем разгадать эту тайну.
Мы сдержали слово и ровно в семь, оставив нашу двуколку у придорожного трактира, явились
в «Медные буки». Даже если бы мисс Хантер с улыбкой на лице и не ждала нас на пороге, мы все
равно узнали бы дом, увидев деревья с темными листьями, сверкающими, как начищенная медь, в
лучах заходящего солнца.
– Удалось? – только и спросил Холмс.
Откуда-то снизу доносился глухой стук.
– Это миссис Толлер в погребе, – объяснила мисс Xантер.
– А ее муж храпит в кухне на полу. Вот ключи, кажется такие же, как у мистера Рукасла.
– Умница! – восхищенно вскричал Холмс. – А теперь ведите нас, через несколько минут преступление будет раскрыто.
Мы поднялись по лестнице, отперли дверь, прошли по коридору и очутились перед дверью, о
которой рассказывала нам мисс Хантер. Холмс перерезал веревку и снял перекладину. Затем он хотел отпереть дверь, но ни один ключ не подходил к замку. Изнутри не доносилось ни звука, и Холмс
нахмурился.
– Надеюсь, мы не опоздали, – сказал он. – Мне кажется, мисс Хантер, нам лучше войти туда без
вас. Ну-ка, Уотсон, нажмите на дверь влечем, не удастся ли нам открыть ее силой.
Старая, обшарпанная дверь тотчас же уступила нашим объединенным усилиям, и мы ворвались
в комнату. Она была пуста. В ней не было ничего, кроме маленькой жесткой постели, стола и корзины с бельем. Люк на чердак был распахнут, пленница бежала.
– Здесь что-то произошло, – сказал Холмс. – Этот красавчик, очевидно, догадался о намерениях
мисс Хантер и уволок свою жертву.
– Но каким образом?
– Через люк. Сейчас посмотрим, как он это сделал. – Он влез на стол. – Правильно, вот и обрывок веревочной лестницы, привязанной к карнизу. Вот как он это сделал.
– Но это невозможно, – возразила мисс Хантер. – Когда Рукаслы уезжали, никакой лестницы не
было.
– Он вернулся и проделал все, что надо. Говорю вам, это умный и опасный человек. Я не удивлюсь, если услышу на лестнице его шаги. Уотсон, вам лучше приготовить свой пистолет.
Едва он произнес эти слова, как на пороге появился очень полный, крупный мужчина с толстой
палкой в руках. Мисс Хантер вскрикнула и прижалась к стене, но Шерлок Холмс решительно встал
между ними.
– Негодяй! – сказал он. – Куда вы дели свою дочь?

«You villain!» said he, «where's your daughter!»
Толстяк обежал глазами комнату и затем бросил взгляд на люк.
– Это я у вас должен спросить! – закричал он. – Воры! Шпионы и воры! Я поймал вас! Вы в моей власти! Я вам покажу! – Он повернулся и бросился вниз по лестнице.
– Он пошел за собакой! – воскликнула мисс Хантер.
– У меня есть пистолет, – сказал я.
– Надо закрыть парадную дверь, – распорядился Холмс, и мы втроем побежали вниз.
Едва мы спустились, как раздался собачий лай, а затем ужасных вопль, сопровождаемый жутким рычанием. Из соседней двери, спотыкаясь, выскочил пожилой мужчина с красным лицом и дрожащими руками.
– Боже мой! – вскричал он. – Кто-то спустил собаку. Ее не кормили целых два дня. Быстрее, не
то будет поздно!
Мы с Холмсом выбежали из дома и вслед за Толлером завернули за угол. Огромный зверь с
черной мордой терзал за горло Рукасла, а тот корчился на земле и кричал. Подбежав к собаке, я выстрелив; она упала, но белые ее клыки так и остались в жирных складках шеи. С большим трудом мы
оторвали собаку от Рукасла и понесли его, еще живого, но жестоко искалеченного, в дом. Мы положили его на диван в гостиной, послали протрезвевшего Толлера за его женой, а я попытался по мере
сил и возможностей облегчить положение раненого. Мы все стояли вокруг него, когда дверь отворилась и в комнату вошла высокая худая женщина.
Running up, I blew its brains out.
– Миссис Толлер! – воскликнула мисс Хантер.
– Да, мисс, это я. Мистер Рукасл отпер погреб, когда вернулся, а потом уж пошел наверх к вам.
Как жаль, мисс, что вы не рассказали мне о своих намерениях. Я бы убедила вас, что вы стараетесь
напрасно.
– Так! – воскликнул Холмс, пристально глядя на нее. – Значит, мисс Толлер известно об этом
деле больше, чем кому-либо другому.
– Да, сэр, и я готова рассказать, что знаю.

– Тогда, пожалуйста, садитесь, и мы послушаем, некоторые детали, признаюсь, я еще не совсем
уяснил.
– Постараюсь прояснить их, – сказала она. – Я бы сделала это и раньше, если бы сумела выбраться из погреба. Коли вмешается полиция, прошу вас помнить, что я была на вашей стороне и помогла мисс Алисе.
У мисс Алисы не было счастья с тех пор, как ее отец женился вторично. На нее не обращали
внимания, с ней не считались. Но совсем плохо стало, когда у своей подруги она познакомилась с
молодым мистером Фаулером. Насколько мне известно, у мисс Алисы по завещанию были собственные деньги, но уж такой робкой и терпеливой она была, что и словом не заикнулась про них, а просто
передала все в руки мистера Рукасла. Он знал, что в отношении денег ему беспокоиться не о чем.
Однако перспектива замужества, когда супруг может потребовать все, что принадлежит ему по закону, заставила его призадуматься и решить, что пора действовать. Он хотел, чтобы она подписала бумагу о том, что он имеет право распоряжаться деньгами, независимо от того, выйдет она замуж или
нет. Она отказалась это сделать, но он не отставал до тех пор, пока у нее не сделалось воспаление
мозга, и шесть недель она находилась между жизнью и смертью. Потом она поправилась, но стала
как тень, а ее прекрасные волосы пришлось остричь. Правда, молодого человека это ничуть не смутило – он по-прежнему оставался ей предан, как и полагается порядочному человеку.
– Ваш рассказ значительно прояснил дело, – заметил Холмс. – Остальное я, пожалуй, в состоянии домыслить сам. Значит, мистер Рукасл применил систему насильственной изоляции?
– Да, сэр.
– И привез миссис Хантер из Лондона, чтобы избавиться от настойчивости мистера Фаулера?
– Именно так, сэр.
– Но мистер Фаулер, будучи человеком упрямым, как и подобает настоящему моряку, осадил
дом, а встретившись с вами, сумел звоном монет и другими способами убедить вас, что у вас с ним
общие интересы.
– Мистер Фаулер умеет уговаривать, человек он щедрый, – безмятежно отозвалась миссис Толлер.
– Ему удалось сделать так, что ваш почтенный супруг не испытывал недостатка в спиртном и
чтобы на тот случай, когда ваш хозяин уедет из дома, лестница была наготове.
– Именно так, сэр, все и произошло.
– Премного вам обязан, миссис Толлер, за то, что вы разъяснили нам кое-какие непонятные вещи, – сказал Холмс. – А вот и здешний доктор и с ним миссис Рукасл! Мне думается, Уотсон, нам
пора взять мисс Хантер с собой в Винчестер, так как наш locus standi26 представляется сейчас довольно сомнительным.
Так была раскрыта тайна страшного дома с медными буками у парадного крыльца. Мистер Рукасл остался жив, но превратился в полного инвалида, и существование его теперь целиком зависит
от забот преданной жены. Они по-прежнему живут вместе со старыми слугами, которым, наверное,
так много известно из прошлой жизни мистера Рукасла, что у него нет сил с ними расстаться. Мистер
Фаулер и мисс Рукасл обвенчались в Саутгемптоне на следующий же день после побега, и сейчас он
правительственный чиновник на острове святого Маврикия. Что же касается мисс Вайолет Хантер,
то мой друг Холмс, к крайнему моему неудовольствию, больше не проявлял к ней никакого интереса,
поскольку она перестала быть центром занимающей его проблемы, и сейчас она трудится на посту
директора частной школы в Уолсоле, делая это, не сомневаюсь, весьма успешно.
